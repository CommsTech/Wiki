##### About Me:
I have 17 years in information technologies. 12 of which are directly related to electronic systems repair. For the past 5 Years I have been a network architect for a very large Organization. I hold multiple certifications from lean six sigma to aws cloud and all the comptia certs in between. 

I built this wiki to expand my knowledge of systems as well as pass on what i have learned from my past experiances.
