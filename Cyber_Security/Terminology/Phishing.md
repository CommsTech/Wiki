# Phishing

Phishing is a social engineering attack that uses email, text messages, or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, or downloading malware. Phishing attacks often appear legitimate but are designed to deceive users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts or systems.

## Techniques Used in Phishing Attacks

1. **Email Phishing**: Sending emails that appear to be from reputable sources, such as banks, social media platforms, or popular services, with links or attachments that install malware or steal credentials when clicked.
2. **Spear Phishing**: Targeting specific individuals or organizations with personalized messages that appear to come from trusted contacts or companies, often using social engineering tactics to gain trust and extract sensitive information.
3. **Smishing**: Using text messages to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware by pretending to be a trusted source, such as their bank or a delivery service.
4. **Vishing**: Using voice calls or phone messages to trick users into providing sensitive information or transferring funds to attackers.
5. **Whaling**: Targeting high-level executives or other important personnel within an organization with sophisticated phishing attacks designed to gain access to sensitive corporate data or financial information.

## Detection and Mitigation

Detecting and mitigating phishing attacks requires:

1. **User Education**: Educating users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links, downloading unverified attachments, and providing sensitive information over email or text messages can help prevent successful phishing attacks.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implementing 2FA for critical accounts can add an additional layer of security and make it more difficult for attackers to gain access even if credentials are stolen.
3. **Email Filtering**: Using email filters to block known phishing emails based on their content, sender, or other characteristics can help prevent successful attacks.
4. **Browser Security Extensions**: Installing browser security extensions that warn users about known phishing websites and block malicious scripts can help protect against web-based phishing attacks.
5. **Regularly Updating Software**: Keeping all software up-to-date is essential to protect against known vulnerabilities that could be exploited in phishing attacks.
