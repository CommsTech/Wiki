# Malware

Malware is malicious software designed to harm a computer system, steal data, or gain unauthorized access. Malware can take various forms and can be spread through email attachments, downloads, or infected websites.

## Types of Malware

1. **[[Viruses]]**: Self-replicating programs that modify other files or programs on a victim's computer.
2. **[[Worms]]**: Self-replicating programs that can spread from one computer to another without human intervention.
3. **[[Trojans]]**: Programs disguised as legitimate software, designed to gain unauthorized access to a system or network.
4. **[[Ransomware]]**: Malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.
5. **[[Spyware]]**: Software that collects information about a user without their knowledge or consent, often used for targeted advertising or identity theft.
6. **[[Adware]]**: Software that displays unwanted advertisements or modifies browser settings without the user's consent.
7. **[[Rootkit]]**: Malware that provides unauthorized access, control, and privilege escalation on a computer system or network.

## Detection and Mitigation

Detecting and mitigating malware requires:

1. **Antivirus Software**: Installing and updating antivirus software can help protect against known malware threats.
2. **Firewalls**: Configuring firewalls to block known malicious IP addresses and ports can help prevent malware infections.
3. **User Education**: Educating users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links, downloading unverified software, and using strong, unique passwords can help reduce the risk of malware infections.
4. **Software Updates**: Keeping all software up-to-date is essential to protect against known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware.
5. **Regular Backups**: Creating regular backups of important data can help minimize the damage caused by ransomware and other types of malware that encrypt or delete files.
