# Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting plain text into an encoded format to protect data from unauthorized access. Encryption plays a crucial role in securing sensitive information, both online and offline.

## Types of Encryption

1. **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption, making it faster but requiring secure key management. Examples include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES).
2. **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses two different keys – a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Asymmetric encryption is slower but offers better security, making it ideal for securing digital communications. Examples include RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
3. **Hash Functions**: Convert data into a fixed-size output that represents the original data's unique digital fingerprint. Hash functions are not encryption algorithms but play an essential role in ensuring data integrity and securing passwords. Examples include SHA-256 and MD5.

## Encryption Algorithms

1. **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: A symmetric encryption algorithm widely used to protect sensitive data, both online and offline.
2. **Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm commonly used for securing digital communications, such as email and secure websites.
3. **Blowfish**: A symmetric encryption algorithm that offers good performance and security, often used in conjunction with a key derivation function like PBKDF2 or scrypt.
4. **Twofish**: An advanced symmetric encryption algorithm that provides strong security and is an improvement over Blowfish.
5. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: A modern asymmetric encryption algorithm that offers stronger security with smaller key sizes compared to RSA.

## Encryption Modes

1. **Electronic Codebook (ECB) Mode**: The simplest encryption mode, where the same plaintext block encrypted with the same key results in the same ciphertext block. ECB is vulnerable to pattern recognition and should be avoided for sensitive data.
2. **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode**: Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption, making it
