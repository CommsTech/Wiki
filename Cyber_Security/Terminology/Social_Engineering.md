# Social Engineering

Social engineering is the use of psychological manipulation to trick users into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise their security. Social engineering attacks often rely on exploiting human emotions, trust, and social relationships to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks.

## Common Social Engineering Techniques

1. **Phishing**: Sending emails, text messages, or messages through social media platforms that appear to be from a trusted source, requesting users to click on malicious links or download attachments containing malware.
2. **Pretexting**: Creating a false but believable scenario to manipulate victims into providing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise their security.
3. **Baiting**: Offering an incentive, such as a free gift or prize, to trick users into downloading malware or revealing sensitive information.
4. **Quid Pro Quo**: Offering something of value in exchange for access to sensitive information or systems.
5. **Tailgating**: Gaining physical access to secure areas by impersonating an authorized personnel or exploiting social relationships.

## Detection and Mitigation

Detecting and mitigating social engineering attacks requires:

1. **User Education**: Educating users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links, downloading unverified software, and sharing sensitive information with untrusted sources can help prevent successful social engineering attacks.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implementing MFA adds an additional layer of security to user accounts, making it more difficult for attackers to gain access through social engineering techniques.
3. **Security Policies and Procedures**: Establishing clear policies and procedures for handling sensitive information and granting access to systems can help prevent unauthorized access through social engineering attacks.
4. **Access Controls**: Implementing strong access controls, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege principles, can help limit the impact of successful social engineering attacks.
5. **Security Awareness Training**: Regularly training employees and users about the latest social engineering tactics and how to identify and respond to them can help prevent successful attacks.
