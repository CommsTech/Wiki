# Cryptojacking

Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge or consent. Cryptojacking can result in increased electricity usage, decreased system performance, and potential privacy concerns.

## Techniques Used for Cryptojacking

1. **Browser Hijacking**: Injecting malicious JavaScript code into websites that runs in the background when users visit the site, using their CPU power to mine cryptocurrency.
2. **Malware**: Installing malware on a victim's device that uses their processing power to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge or consent.
3. **Mobile Applications**: Infecting mobile applications with malware that runs in the background, using the device's processing power to mine cryptocurrency.
4. **Torrents and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks**: Downloading torrents or using P2P networks that contain malicious files or scripts that use the user's CPU to mine cryptocurrency.

## Detection and Mitigation

Detecting and mitigating cryptojacking requires:

1. **Antivirus Software**: Installing and updating antivirus software can help protect against known cryptojacking malware.
2. **Browser Extensions**: Using reputable browser extensions that block known cryptojacking scripts and websites can help prevent browser hijacking.
3. **Ad Blockers**: Installing ad blockers can help prevent some forms of cryptojacking, as they can block the JavaScript code used to mine cryptocurrency in the background.
4. **System Monitoring**: Regularly monitoring system resources, such as CPU usage and power consumption, can help detect unusual activity that may indicate cryptojacking.
5. **User Education**: Educating users about the risks of downloading unverified software, clicking on suspicious links, and using strong, unique passwords can help reduce the risk of cryptojacking.
