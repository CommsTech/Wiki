# Botnets

Botnets are networks of compromised computers or devices, also known as "zombies," that can be controlled remotely by cybercriminals. The attackers use these networks to launch various types of cyber attacks, such as DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks, spam campaigns, and data theft.

## Components of a Botnet

1. [[Command_and_Control_Servers|Command and Control (C&C) Server]]: This is the central server that manages and controls the botnet. It sends instructions to the infected devices and receives reports from them.
2. [[Botnets|Botmaster]]: The person or group that operates the botnet, often referred to as the "botmaster."
3. [[Bots_and_Zombies|Bots/Zombies]]: The compromised devices that are part of the botnet. They receive commands from the C&C server and execute them.

## Types of Botnets

1. **P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Botnets**: In this type, each bot communicates directly with other bots in the network instead of relying on a central C&C server. This makes it harder to take down the botnet as there is no single point of control.
2. **Hybrid Botnets**: These botnets use both centralized and decentralized structures, combining the advantages of both P2P and C&C servers.

## Prevention and Mitigation

1. **Keep Software Up-to-Date**: Regularly update all software on your devices to protect against known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by botnets.
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Use complex, unique passwords for all accounts and change them regularly.
3. **Firewall and Antivirus Protection**: Ensure you have a reliable firewall and antivirus software installed on your devices.
4. **Email Security**: Be cautious when opening emails from unknown sources or clicking on links within them.
5. **Network Segmentation**: Separate critical systems from the internet and other less sensitive networks to limit the potential damage if a botnet infection occurs.
6. **Employee Training**: Educate employees about the risks of botnets and how to identify and avoid potential threats.
