# Adware

Adware is a type of software that displays unwanted advertisements or modifies browser settings without the user's consent. While some adware is legitimate and bundled with free software, others are malicious and can pose security risks. Malicious adware can be used as a vector for delivering malware or generating revenue for cybercriminals through click fraud.

## Characteristics of Adware

1. **Unwanted Advertisements**: Adware displays unwanted advertisements in various forms, such as pop-ups, banners, or full-screen ads, which can be intrusive and annoying.
2. **Browser Redirection**: Some adware modifies browser settings to redirect users to malicious websites or search engines, exposing them to potential threats.
3. **Performance Impact**: Adware can consume significant system resources, leading to slower performance and decreased productivity.

1. **Antivirus Software**: Installing and updating antivirus software can help protect against known adware and other malware.
2. **Browser Settings**: Configuring browser settings to block pop-ups, disable third-party cookies, and use a reputable search engine can help reduce the risk of adware infections.
