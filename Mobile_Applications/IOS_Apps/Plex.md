Apple IOS Devices
In order to change  the Plex video quality settings on Apple IOS devices (iphones, ipads & ipods).  From the home screen hit the "hamburger menu" button in the upper left hand corner.

 

From there find the settings icon that looks like a Gear on the menu screen that slides out from the left.

 


 

From the Settings menu find and select the Quality section:


 

Below is what you should see when you first open the Quality section:


 

We have to change a few things here,  First click on Remote Streaming, now you'll notice that there isn't an option for Original or Maximum like a lot of the other device.  That's because it's hidden by default.

Select the Show All menu option from the list.
 


 

Then you will see the option we are looking for:

Select Maximum
 


 

Hit the < in the upper left and you will return to this screen, make sure your selections match these below:

Automatically Adjust Quality: DISABLED
Limit Cellular Data: 0.7 Mpbs, 320p
Remote Streaming: Maximum
Home Streaming: Maximum
