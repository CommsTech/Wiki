# How to Make AI Content Undetectable in 2024

Since the introduction of AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), people have been exploring how they can use AI in all areas of life and business.

For anyone creating content or selling online, the ability to generate AI content and quickly scale content marketing strategies is an exciting idea. But if the AI content sounds like it was written by a computer, people won’t want to read it. And Google might consider your AI content as spam.

But how can you make AI content undetectable to other AIs and your human readers? One way to test your AI content is by running it through AI content detectors, which are tools that help you figure out if your AI-generated content sounds robotic.

Here’s how to find out if your AI content sets off alarms and the steps you can take to make your AI content undetectable.

## What is AI-generated content?

AI-generated content is content like blog posts, articles and product descriptions that are written by a computer using artificial intelligence software. The AI tool generates content using human input, such as the topic, keywords and type of copy.

Examples of AI tools that you can use to generate content include:

- ChatGPT and [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4): Can create multiple types of content depending on what you ask for, including short and long-form.
- [Copysmith](https://copysmith.ai/): Used for marketing and eCommerce content.
- [Jasper.ai](https://www.jasper.ai/): Long-form content creation, including books and articles.
- [Adzis](https://adzis.com/): [eCommerce content](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/marketing-for-ecommerce/) creation, including product descriptions and chatbot scripts.
- [Copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/): Short-form AI content that can be used for [blogs](https://www.bluehost.com/how-to-start-a-blog), [website copy](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/12-useful-tips-for-writing-compelling-website-copy/), social media and sales assets.
- [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/): An answer engine that combines information from other AI content-creator tools and can be used for research and content creation.

## How is AI-generated content detected?

AI detectors use a combination of [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) and [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) features to sift through content and figure out whether it was most likely created by an AI tool or written by a person.

These AI content detection tools compare the writing that’s being tested with a large volume of content data from the rest of the internet. They use the dataset of existing content to predict the most likely words and phrases used for the related topic.

The more predictable the piece of test writing is, the more likely it is AI writing it instead of it being written by a human. At least, that’s how the program scores the text. It is entirely possible to get a false positive reading on something written by a human, depending on the writing style.

In short, here are some of the clues that may flag your text as AI content.

- Repetitive sentence structure.
- Predictable word patterns.
- Lack of transitions and casual phrasing.

### Common mistakes that make AI content detectable

If you’re using AI to create content, there’s a chance that one of these detection tools can figure that out.

Here are some of the common AI content mistakes that can make your AI-generated content more likely to be caught.

- Using an AI tool to write the entire piece of content.
- Using the first draft of AI-generated output without changing any phrasing.
- Not adjusting your AI-generated content for the reader’s experience.
- Not making edits to the AI-generated content for your brand’s voice or tone.

In other words, if you don’t make any changes to an AI draft, it’s going to be more likely that an AI detection tool will flag the content as AI-generated.

## How to see if your AI content is detectable

You can use online AI content detectors to test your writing. Many of the most popular AI detection tools are free to use online. These include:

- [Copyleaks](https://copyleaks.com/ai-content-detector)
- [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/)
- [Writer](https://writer.com/ai-content-detector/)
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier)

To use these tools, paste your text into the tool, and you’ll get a score or estimate of how much of your content was generated by AI.

![AI content detector tool Copyleaks.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:315/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Copyleaks-AI-detector.png)

Screenshot

For example, if you test our sample paragraph that ChatGPT created with the Copyleaks detector, it is pretty sure the paragraph is AI content. Each detector uses slightly different algorithms and might return different results.

![Writer AI content detector results.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:273/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Writer-AI-content-detector.png)

Screenshot

When checked by another content detection tool, Writer, the text gets a score of 68% human-written content, which means that 32% of the content has been flagged as AI-generated.

### A note on AI content detectors

AI content detection tools are not perfect. In some cases, they may fail to detect AI-generated writing or even flag human-written content as AI. That being said, they are still a helpful tool for quickly evaluating whether or not your content might read like AI-generated content based on the predictability of the sentence structure, words and phrases.

Ultimately, your goal is to publish content that connects with your readers. You want them to feel like it was written by a human and not generated as output from an AI chatbot. So it’s always a good idea to review AI content yourself. If it sounds a little off or robotic, you may want to tweak it so it comes across as more conversational and human.

## How to make AI content undetectable

1. Use Undetectable.ai to rewrite the AI content
2. Ask ChatGPT to rewrite that content
3. Use Quillbot to rephrase the content
4. Change the syntax and vocabulary

### 1. Use Undetectable.ai

[Undetectable AI](https://undetectable.ai/) is a writing tool that rewrites AI content for the purpose of getting past content detectors. All you have to do is copy and paste your text into the editor, and it will re-process it using new words, structure and phrasing.

With Undetectable AI, you can change settings such as the reading difficulty level and the purpose of the writing. For example, take our sample paragraph generated by ChatGPT and run it through Undetectable using “High school” readability and “Marketing material” purpose.

![Undetectable AI results.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:625/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Undetectable-AI-results.png)

Screenshot

After processing your text in Undetectable AI, you can run the new version through a detection tool to see if it passes.

![Writer’s AI content detector results for Undetectable AI text.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:301/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Writer-AI-content-Undetectable-AI.png)

Screenshot

When run through Writer, the new content passed as 100% human text. That being said, you would still have to adjust for grammar issues like adding commas in lists and after transition phrases.

Undetectable AI offers a free trial for the first 250 words generated. After that, it offers [several paid plans](https://undetectable.ai/pricing) starting at $9.99 per month for up to 10,000 words.

### 2. Ask ChatGPT to rewrite AI-generated content

While paying for a service may seem like the simplest answer to how to make AI content undetectable if you’re not ready to subscribe to an AI text masking tool, there are some free options to help adjust your text.

Another option involves asking your original AI text generator to rewrite its own output.

![Example of ChatGPT rewriting a paragraph.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:531/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ChatGPT-rewrite-paragraph.png)

Screenshot

The second round of processing means that the tool has to use different words and phrasing, making it more likely that it will pass as human text because it will be less predictable.

![Writer’s AI content detector test results for rewritten ChatGPT text.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:329/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Writer-AI-detects-ChatGPT-text.png)

Screenshot

As you can see in the screenshot, the text that ChatGPT rewrote is no longer detected as AI-generated. Instead, the tool estimates that a human wrote 99% of the text.

Also, it bears noting that [different versions of ChatGPT](https://www.coolcatteacher.com/what-do-i-do-if-i-think-chat-gpt-wrote-my-students-paper/) don’t recognize text created by their siblings. So using different versions of ChatGPT to rewrite text adds another layer of uniqueness.

### 4. Use Quillbot to rephrase

[Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/) is an AI-powered paraphrasing tool you can use to rewrite human or AI-generated content. It has different modes, like Fluency, Creative and Simple, that you can choose from depending on your brand’s voice and your [target audience](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/what-is-a-target-audience-and-how-to-define-yours-through-target-market-analysis/). You can also click on any of the rewritten words to get a list of other synonyms to quickly tailor your text.

![Quillbot rewrite output.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:317/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Quillbot-rewrite-output.png)

Screenshot

Quillbot lets you see which text the tool changed and run the new version through a grammar check for a quick polish.

![Writer’s AI content detector test results for Quillbot text.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:292/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Writer-AI-detects-Quillbot.png)

Screenshot

The new text from Quillbot passed the detection test with an estimate that a human wrote 93% of the text. So while detectors might miss your content as AI-generated, human readers might still think parts of it sound slightly robotic.

### 5. Change syntax and vocabulary

Finally, your ultimate weapon in figuring out how to make AI content undetectable is to combine AI and human writing to get past AI content detectors and make your readers feel comfortable.

![Manually edited text paragraph.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:477/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Manually-edited-text-paragraph.png)

Screenshot

With this method, you want to focus on:

- Changing repetitive sentence structure by moving clauses or breaking long sentences up into shorter ones.
- Replacing commonly used words and phrases with synonyms.
- Adding transition phrases.
- Using contractions to sound more conversational.
- Including first- and second-person pronouns, depending on your brand’s writing style.

![Writer’s AI content detection results for manually rewritten text.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:275/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Writer-AI-detects-manually-rewritten.png)

Screenshot

In this example, a handful of changes bumped the Writer score on the passage to 98% written by a human. While this method may take more work than others, it also lets you adjust the text for your target audience and ensure the language matches your brand’s voice.

## Why you should make your AI content undetectable

But the biggest question is, why go through all this work? Why does anyone even need to know how to make AI content undetectable?

AI-generated content is fast, but it doesn’t always appeal to human readers or search bots. Here are the biggest reasons to camouflage your AI content.

### Improve SEO performance

Google [doesn’t ban AI-generated content](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content). But, the company focuses on removing [spammy content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#spammy-automatically-generated-content) from its search engine results and includes automated text in that category. Text that hasn’t been reviewed for user experience and text generated using synonymizing or paraphrasing tools is most likely to be penalized.

Editing your AI writing helps ensure that you’re always putting out high-quality content, which is key for improving [your website’s SEO](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/an-overview-of-seo/).

### Improve readability

Overused words and repetitive sentence structure can create a negative (or at least boring) [reader experience](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/user-experience-meaning-importance-and-tips-to-improve/). These issues are most likely to show up on the first draft of AI-generated text, which can result in readers failing to engage with your content and going elsewhere for their information.

### Set your content apart

AI content generators are not built to create unique content. The content is based on predictability. As more companies use AI writers in their marketing, there’s a risk of everyone sounding the same.

By manually editing and reprocessing your content, you can publish human-like content that sounds different from other brands and gives you a competitive advantage.

### Appeal to your readers

At the end of the day, you know your audience and your brand’s writing style best. While an easy-to-read text is good. Making an actual connection is better. Tweaking AI content to resonate with your specific readers will help you create long-term relationships that lead to sales and revenue.

Remember that your readers are the ultimate test. If they think your content sounds more robot than human, you may start losing connection and credibility.

## Benefits of using AI content

![Benefits of using AI content.](https://mlx3lspc9ed5.i.optimole.com/cb:iQfv.350f5/w:710/h:399/q:mauto/f:best/https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/AI-content-benefits.png)

If you have to edit the content you get from AI, is it worth using it? For many marketers, the answer is “Yes.”

Here’s a closer look at the benefit of including AI-generated text in your content writing process.

- **Efficiency:** AI speeds up content creation and can write articles (at least first drafts) in seconds instead of the hours needed by human writers.

- **Scale:** Smaller marketing teams can use AI tools to scale their content operations. For example, starting with an AI draft and editing it for style saves time and enables people to publish more. You can also use AI to generate text for social media posts, which can be time-consuming to do without writing tools.

- **Beat writer’s block:** AI is a great tool to deal with writer’s block by generating new content ideas for your human writers.

- **Cost savings:** Investing in AI writing tools can be a cost-effective alternative to outsourcing all parts of your content workflow. Even if you only use AI for part of the process, it can save you time and money.

## Final thoughts: How to make AI content undetectable and sound more human

The marketing and content creation benefits of AI are just starting to be realized. As a content writing tool, it can be a useful and cost-effective way to get more out of your marketing strategy.

That being said, it’s still important to review content before it goes out, no matter who wrote it. This way, you can ensure a positive reader experience and create the type of consistent, [high-quality content](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/5-tips-writing-website-copy-will-capture-visitors-attention/) that keeps people coming back.

Part of keeping people coming back is a [reliable hosting solution](https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/shared) for your website or blog, and [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) can help with a variety of fast and secure hosting plans.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can Google detect AI-written content?**

Google uses a variety of tools to detect spammy content, including spam content created by AI writing tools. If your AI-generated content is not high-quality or doesn’t prioritize the user experience, it may be flagged as spam.

**How does Google detect AI content?**

Google uses tools like [SpamBrain](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content), to detect spam content, which can include both AI-generated and human-written content. There are also other content detectors that use language models and machine learning algorithms to identify AI-generated text.

**What is the best AI detector?**

[Originality.AI](https://originality.ai/) is one of the overall top-rated AI detectors, while [Copyleaks](https://copyleaks.com/) is often recommended for content marketers. Both options highlight which text was flagged as AI, and they also have built-in plagiarism checkers.

**What is the best AI writer?**

The best AI writer for you depends on the type of content you’re creating. [Jasper AI](https://www.jasper.ai/) is recommended for long-form content, while [Copy AI](https://www.copy.ai/) is more useful for website and social media copy. [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) can be used for a wide variety of content creation needs.

If you’ve been breathing oxygen, you've probably realized **[ChatGPT](https://goldpenguin.org/blog/openai-chatgpt-released/)** is just amazing. Every time I use it I'm mind blown.

Over the last year we’ve seen a technical revolution of something similar to when the internet came out. OpenAI, the company behind it all, continues to ship groundbreaking products across the AI world & isn't showing any signs of slowing down.

Their most recent change, GPT-4 & GPT-4-Turbo, are some of the most powerful public language models ever created. They're capable of producing writing with quality on par of human writers.

If this is true, has AI writing reached the point where it’s now completely [**undetectable**](https://goldpenguin.org/go/undetectable-ai) and indistinguishable from human writing? Not quite…

The oversimplified explanation of how AI Writing works is it predicts the following words of a sentence based on the words that come before it.

Think about it this way:

If you made someone read 10,000 cardiology textbooks and then asked them to recite how the heart works, they’d probably have a boilerplate answer nailed into their head.

This is sort of how generative AI works. You train a model on a bunch of data, and when trying to retrieve knowledge, you’ll get very specific & boilerplate answers.

Now when it comes to how much info ChatGPT is trained on, it hurts to even think about. It's not even public knowledge. GPT-3 (the previous model) was trained on **[175 billion](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/22673/what-exactly-are-the-parameters-in-gpt-3s-175-billion-parameters-and-how-are)** to give you some perspective.

The same way AI tools generate writing is actually the exact opposite method of how it’s detected.

AI detection tools like **[Originality](https://goldpenguin.org/go/Originality)** and **[Content at Scale](https://goldpenguin.org/go/CAS-AI-Detection)** try to reverse engineer the writing you enter to see how similar it would be to an AI tool like ChatGPT having to rewrite it.

**Here’s an example sentence:** I really want to go to the ______.

Maybe 90% of the time the AI is going to write “beach.” But that’s not what I was going to say.

My sentence would’ve ended with “trampoline park”.

Human writing is _very_ versatile and AI writing just tries to repeatedly emulate the patterns it thinks you're most likely looking for.

The same logic also applies for an entire article, essay, or report. The more likely writing aligns with what an AI would’ve written by itself, the higher chance it was written with AI.

_So, what’s the solution?_

You have to use words and structure sentences in a way that an AI writing generator wouldn’t use. **You can't definitively predict AI text.** There's no watermark that gets left behind to prove anything (unlike how plagiarism checkers show you the exact content somebody stole from).

With AI detection, it's just a bunch of words. But for now, AI still writes at a level that can be somewhat predicted, at least if the vocabulary and sentence scrambling aren't too complex.

If you're trying to make your AI writing undetectable, there's a few things you could do to help get around these somewhat faulty detection tools.

## How to Make AI Writing Undetectable & Bypass Detection

A few online tools make it fairly easy to remove obvious AI-written text from tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, etc (really any kind of AI writing software).

These undetection tools all combine machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to identify patterns in the text and then get rid of them.

You need to focus on making the text sound more real, ensure it flows logically, and just make sure it doesn't repeat itself.

While it may be tempting to use AI to breeze through assignments or work tasks, it's important to be mindful of the potential consequences. Please don't do anything unethical or illegal. This is all at your own risk.

### Using AI Writing Scrambling Tools

AI has led to tools that hide AI-written text better. They shuffle words, rephrase sentences, and use synonyms. For example, "Exercise improves heart health" becomes "Heart health gets better with regular activity." This keeps the meaning but seems more human. It confuses detection tools by mimicking human writing's variety and style.

#### Undetectable.ai

The first tool I'd highly recommend using is **[Undetectable.ai](https://goldpenguin.org/go/undetectable-ai)**. They help change your content to suit various writing styles, such as essays, general writing, marketing material, and more.

To use Undetectable AI, simply paste your text into the tool, and choose the appropriate readability level and tone for your specific writing style.

Once you click the "Humanize" button, the service will work its magic, converting your AI-generated content into text that is not only coherent and engaging but also indistinguishable from human-written material.

I took a ChatGPT response about pizza and rephrased it. Check it out:

![](https://goldpenguin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3.png)

![](https://goldpenguin.org/blog/make-ai-writing-undetectable/context.core.image.imageCurrentSrc)

![](https://goldpenguin.org/blog/make-ai-writing-undetectable/selectors.core.image.enlargedImgSrc)

And look how it did when I threw it in [Copyleaks](https://goldpenguin.org/go/copyleaks).

![](https://goldpenguin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-4.png)

Make sure to reread content as sometimes the rephrasing inserts synonyms and styles that don't actually make sense given the context of the writing. But this is quite rare.

I'm just saying these tools should always be used as an assistant, not a replacement. But for an automatic tool, [Undetectable](https://goldpenguin.org/go/undetectable) is AMAZING.

I also can't emphasize enough to use this service (and the rest of the ones below) responsibly and ethically. Don't submit anything that could get you in trouble if this isn't something you're allowed to do.

#### HideMyAI

Next on the list is.... HideMyAI.

While **[HideMyAI](https://goldpenguin.org/go/hidemyai)** takes a little bit longer to process text & doesn't come with as much complexity, you're still able to get some amazing undetectable content in a matter of seconds.

![](https://goldpenguin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-29-at-8.10.04-PM.png)

![](https://goldpenguin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-29-at-8.10.35-PM.png)

It works the same but scrambles your text rather differently. Just paste any section of ChatGPT-generated writing into the tool and check it out:

![](https://goldpenguin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-29-at-8.13.12-PM.png)

New result reads very well. But how does it do when we put it back into the detector? Pretty damn impressive. Not a single trace. Copyleaks also got a "human-generated" score.

![](https://goldpenguin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-29-at-8.13.44-PM.png)

### Tweak Sentence Syntax

Once you've thrown the writing in one of those tools, it's time to do some manual labor.

You just have to modify the sentence syntax. This involves adjusting the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence, as well as the relationships between them.

This will create subtle variations in the structure of your text, making it harder for AI detection tools to identify patterns that are characteristic of machine-generated content, kind of similar to what **[QuillBot](https://goldpenguin.org/go/quillbot)** offers.

Doing this manually is similar to what we spoke about earlier but requires a lot more personal fine tuning (a software won't do this as extensively as the human eye).

Try switching between active/passive voice, changing vocab, etc. Just make it seem realistic! It might seem annoying to do, but if you're getting something done with ChatGPT in a matter of seconds, you could spend a few minutes going through your writing to make sure it looks like you actually wrote it.

You should also be utilizing a diverse range of sentence lengths and structures. In natural human writing, it's common to find a mix of short and long sentences, as well as a blend of simple, compound, and complex structures. Just match it with your own writing style.

You can mimic the rhythm and cadence of human writing to a waaaay larger degree in just a few tweaks. Readability is key!!!

### Use Higher Level Vocabulary

Another great technique for making AI-generated content less detectable is to incorporate higher-level vocabulary into your writing. This not only elevates the quality of your content but also helps to obscure the telltale signs that it was produced by an AI.

To use higher-level vocabulary, consider replacing common or overused words with more precise or specialized terms. For instance, instead of using the word "important," you could opt for "crucial," "pivotal," or "indispensable."

Likewise, you can employ technical jargon or industry-specific terminology when discussing a particular subject, which lends credibility and depth to your content. Tools like **[QuillBot](https://goldpenguin.org/go/quillbot)** are actually perfect for this, they let you paragraph word by word & sentence by sentence until you're happy with your new paragraph.

![QuillBot paraphrased text for AI content](https://goldpenguin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-27.png)

Keep in mind that while using advanced vocabulary can make your writing more human-like, you need to find a balance between **sophistication and readability** (I'm assuming you'll have real humans read this somewhere, right?!)

Your content should remain accessible and engaging to your target audience, so avoid using obscure words that might confuse or alienate readers. Always keep in mind user intent, it wouldn't be worth over sophisticating your text if you are writing an article for 5th graders just for the sake of bypassing AI detection.

In addition to higher-level vocabulary, you can also make use of synonyms and paraphrasing to add richness to your content. This approach not only helps to mask the AI-generated nature of your text but also improves its overall flow and cohesion.

By diversifying your word choice and experimenting with different ways to express your ideas, you can create a more dynamic and compelling piece of writing that effectively evades detection by AI analysis tools while still naturally getting your point across.

## Final Thoughts & Advice

Transforming AI-generated content into text that is indistinguishable from human-written material is a fascinating and an increasingly relevant topic ever since ChatGPT launched. It's getting tricky though.

Throw your writing into a tool like [Undetectable](https://goldpenguin.org/go/undetectable) or [HideMyAI](https://goldpenguin.org/go/hidemyai) and then do some manual editing and you'll be good in a matter of minutes.

It's a crazy world we've just entered and we're only at the beginning of a the road. It'll be an interesting few years for sure.

Is your content [AI detectable](https://contentatscale.ai/ai-content-detector/)?

Or are you making sure you’re publishing undetectable AI content?

It’s 2023, and AI writers are not only here, they’re in mainstream use by [smart website owners that want to save time and money.](https://contentatscale.ai/aio-model/)

However, here’s the catch-22: you as a brand owner/marketer/publisher MUST publish content that passes as 100% human if you want to stay on the ‘human’ side of content, earn rankings, build trust, and present a site that falls within Google’s E-E-A-T parameters (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness).

**But what happens when an AI detector flags even** **_human_** **content as having a low predictability of human writing?**

Like this one, which has been AI-produced, but the sentences flagged in our [AI detector](https://contentatscale.ai/ai-content-detector/) were actually written by a human:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fAa5_uDuSOXLt2f73BNp0prGMskXzh6ae-mKQyJqjhajoscwVW9vrqMXr7ihU7Bq6ZO6VJPznlLikxS92EKciMZ7dAD3y8mLjy61sxzkxb37lTZlCwgkklweSfhVdtT7bokhvsvbn_L9ca5Qg5Lyiao)

This has been happening to a lot of human writers, and it’s frustrating!

Here’s the sauce.

Remember, AI detectors don’t actually tell us if the content is written by an AI. They tell us how _likely_ it is that content is written by AI.

So, if you’re writing like a robot – AI detectors will actually call you out.  

  

“That sounds like a robot wrote it.”

I’ve been facing this my whole life while training writers. Because here’s the thing – engaging, high-quality, awesome content _doesn’t come easy._ That means the skill doesn’t come easy, either.

A tale as old as time…

By nature, **new or inexperienced writers tend to write stiff sentences that read like robots wrote them.**

## Using CRAFT Framework to Bypass AI Detection

Funny, how time tells no new tales. Here we are–with robots writing our content… and we’re facing the same old grammar problems we always faced with new writers.

But that’s why the human will still be needed after all.

Because you’ve got to:

- Cut the fluff
- Review, edit, optimize (improve) your work
- Add media, images, and visuals to build more elements
- Fact-check for accuracy
- Trust-build with story, tone, and links

Yep, that’s our [CRAFT framework:](https://contentatscale.ai/how-to-cut-fluff/)

![craft framework by julia content at scale](https://contentatscale.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/craft-framework-by-julia-content-at-scale-1024x576.png.webp)

Two of the most important steps here are the first two. Cutting the fluff means eliminating the words that seem robotic, stuffy, and just plain _boring._ But that’s not all. You then need to _review_ the content you wrote to make sure it flows. You need to reassemble, play around with, and adjust the flow of your content.

(Example: I just went back and moved two of my paragraphs out of the introduction of this piece, then wrote two new ones. The reviewing you do of your writing is arguably one of the most important pieces here.)

When you’re using AI to write, you can **_still_** make sure your content rates as humanly-produced.

Here’s how.

## Before & After: Creating AI Content That Outsmarts AI Detection

This is a piece on fact-checking that I had Content at Scale write.

We start out with this intro, and if I run it through our [free AI detector](https://contentatscale.ai/ai-content-detector/), it comes back as 77% detectable. (As of now, our tool just _got better_ at creating undetectable AI content with a new app launch! This was back when the launch hadn’t happened yet.)

Here’s the text it wrote:

|As technology continues to evolve, so too does the need for accurate and reliable information. Fact-checking is an important process that helps writers make sure their content is truthful and well-sourced before it’s published online or in print. But when it comes to AI content, fact-checking takes on a whole new level of complexity. Here, we’ll explore what fact-checking means for AI generated articles, how to verify facts and sources properly, some useful tools available for checking accuracy within these pieces of writing – as well as best practices for ensuring your own work remains true and trustworthy – all with the goal of helping you become more confident in publishing quality content through artificial intelligence platforms. Let’s get started by exploring what exactly ‘fact-check’ entails.|

And here’s what our [free AI detector](https://contentatscale.ai/ai-content-detector/) scored it as:

(Again, remember–this was before our app rollout where the app itself is now _rewriting_ these sentences for you, generating 90% or higher human-scoring content. At Content at Scale, our goal is undetectable content, and we spend a lot of resources on the product to make sure it stays that way!)

So, here’s how we tailored that intro to sound more human-like.

- Shorter paragraphs
- Less wordiness
- Finding new, better ways to say something

Here’s the final result:

We pass the human content score with 92%!

And, AI _still wrote and came up with the majority of this_ hook (blog opener).

Boom!

Human content, but it’s AI-produced and human-optimized by yours truly.

That’s why the [**O** in our AIO framework](https://contentatscale.ai/aio-writer/) is _ESSENTIAL._ You must optimize the content that AI outputs so it’s better, stronger, and more effective.

## So, How Do You Write Less Like a Robot?

Here are some steps you can take to break free of the robot-writing curse.

### 1. Use an AI Detector

Let our AI detector tell you if you sound like a robot – and don’t take personal offense if it tells you your sentence is no better than that of a bot! Remember, writing is a little bit like magic: the third time’s the charm. By the third sentence rewrite, you might have something magical. Try, try again; and let the AI detector guide you on whether or not your content has reached a human level. 

### 2. Follow the C.R.A.F.T. Framework 

Remember my acronym for guiding better AIO framework, easily remembered as **CRAFT**ing better content:

1. Cut the fluff

2. Review, edit, optimize

3. Add images, visuals, media

4. Fact-check

5. Trust-build with personal story, tone, links

![craft framework by julia content at scale](https://contentatscale.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/craft-framework-by-julia-content-at-scale-1024x576.png.webp)

You’ll produce better and better content if you follow these simple steps, and remember that content is never a one-shot wonder. It takes time, review, optimization, checking, and rewriting (weaving) to create a beautiful piece of content (a full tapestry).

### 3. Be More Human 

**Write as you speak.**

People _never_ talk like robots. That’s because you’re human!

If you’re not sure if an AI-produced sentence is human or not, sound it out loud. Read it aloud to yourself. Not there yet? Try saying it again with a more natural approach. Whatever comes out of your mouth is the way you want to write.

People want to feel they’re pulled into a conversation – not reading some professor’s essay or thesis piece.

Besides conversational writing… the other part of this is **knowing your audience.** 

Use terminology and language they understand. 

Write in the words you would say if you personally sat down and ‘had coffee’ with them. What would you tell them? Would you be real-talk and direct? Or would you be persuasive and witty? Lean into a consistent voice in your content.

This is a huge part of being more ‘human’ in your content.
