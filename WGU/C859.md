# Introduction to Programming in Python - C859

- A program has 2 instructions the processing instruction and the output instruction
- `#` or comment explains code and is not read by the program, it allows code to be more human readable you can use `#` or `"""`
- Data types can be
	- Built-in
	- `str()` (string) = Text
	- `int()` (integer),  `float()` (float) = numeric
	- `list()`(list), `tuple()`(tuple), `range()`(range) = sequence
	- `bool()`(boolean) = boolean types
- You can get a data type by using the `type()` function
	- For example
- you can specify a data type with casting
	- for example `x = str(10)` or `y = int("3")` or `z = float(3)`
	The resulting output would be x=10 y=3 and z=3.0
- Strings can be defined with either a single or double quote `"`
- A variable is a format used to set a definition to data i.e. `v = 2 or v = python`
	- you can change variable types i.e. `int()` ---> `str()`  or `str()` ----> `int()`
	- Variable Names are Case Sensitive so Capitalization does matter.
- Numbers are expressed as
	- int - positive or negative whole number. it cannot contain decimals
	- float -positive or negative and must contain at least one decimal
- Strings are anything surrounded by single or double quotes
	- Multi-line strings are defined with 3 single or double quotes at the beginning and end of the sting
- Python does not have a count data type. to accomplish this simply take a string and add a number in brackets
	```
	description = ("result = ")
	a = ("hello")

	Print(description)
	Print(a[1])

	# results after running the command
	result =
	e
	# we get a result of e instead of h because h actually holds a place value of "0"

	```

-  Booleans represent true or false
```
print("result for 10 is greater than 9")

print(10 > 9)

print("result for 10 is equal to 9")

print(10 == 9)

print("result for 10 is less than 9")

print(10 < 9)

# Results after running the above command
result for 10 is greater than 9
True

result for 10 is equal to 9
False

result for 10 is less than 9
False

```

- If Statements
```
a = 100
b = 50

if b > a:
	print("b is greater than a")
else:
	print("b is not greater than a")

# Results after running the above command

b is not greater than a
```

- Bool function.
```
print(bool("Hello"))

print(bool(15))

# Results after running the above command
True
True
```
	- Almost all values are true:
		- strings are true except empty strings
		- any number is true except for the number 0
		- Lists, Truples, and Sets are true unless they are black/empty

- Operators - perform operations on variables
	- `+` for addition
	- `-` for subtraction
	- `*` for multiplication
	- `%` for modulus
	-  Assignment Operators
		- x += 3 or x = x + 3 (SAME)
		- x -= 3 or x = x - 3 (SAME)
	- Comparator Operators
		- `==` for Equal to
		- `>=` for Greater than or equal to
		- `<=` for less than or equal to
- Lists
	- Multiple items in 1 variable
	- Built-in Data types
	- used to store collections of data
	- created using `[]`
	- `list = "apples", "bananas", "oranges"` ( this list also has an index apples=0 bananas=1 etc)
```
list = ["apples", "bananas", "oranges"]

print(list)

print(len(list))

Print("Items")

# Results of the above command
"apples", "bananas", "oranges"
This list contains
3
Items

```

- Tuples
	- Multiple items in 1 variable
	- Built-in Data type
	- Used to store collections of data
	- Created using `()` instead of `[]`
```
tuple = ("apples", "bananas", "oranges")

print(tuple)

# Results of the above command
('apples', 'bananas', 'oranges')
```

- Sets
	- built-in data type
	- Used for multiple items in just one variable
	- a collection of unordered, unindexed  items
	- Created using `{}`
	- Duplicate values are ignored

- Dictionaries
	- Used to store key with value pairs
	- built-in data type
	- have been ordered since python 3.7
	- created using `{}`
	- does not allow duplicates
```
# in this example brand, model and year are the keys, and Ford, Focus, and 2010 are the value pairs
dictionary = {
	"brand": "Ford"
	"model": "Focus"
	"year": 2010
}

print(dictionary)

# Results of the above command
{'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Focus', 'year': 2010}
```

- Conditional statements
```
a = 100
b = 200

if b  > a
	print("b is greater than a")
else:
	print("a is greater than b")

# results of the above command
b is greater than a
```

- Indentation
```
def indentation():
	This code is now indented
	And so is this
```

- elfi (Else If)
```
a = 100
b = 100

if b  > a
	print("b is greater than a")
elif a==b:
	print("a and b are both equal")
else:
	print("a is greater than b")

# results of the above command
a and b are both equal
```

- While loop
	- Executes a set of statements for as long as a condition is true
```
i = 1

while i == 1
	print(i)

# Results of the above command
1
1
1
1
# it will just keep going as the command states keep printing as long as i is equal to 1

```

```
i = 1

while i < 1
	print(i)
	i += 1

# Results of the above command
1
2
3
4
5
	# the above command ends at 5 as the number 6 is equal not less than the number 6 value defined in the while statement
```

- For Loops
	- Used for iterating over a sequence i.e. (list, tuple, dictionary, set or a string)

```
fruits = ["apple", "bananas", "orange"]

for x in fruits:
	print(x)
# Results of the above command
apple
bananas
orange
# notice that all results are now on their own line

```

- Arguments
	- information that can be passed into functions is known as arguments
	- you can add as many arguments as you want
