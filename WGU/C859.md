# Introduction to Programming in Python - C859

- A program has 2 instructions the processing instruction and the output instruction
- `#` or comment explains code and is not read by the program, it allows code to be more human readable you can use `#` or `"""`
- Data types can be
	- Built-in
	- `str()` (string) = Text
	- `int()` (integer),  `float()` (float) = numeric
	- `list()`(list), `tuple()`(tuple), `range()`(range) = sequence
	- `bool()`(boolean) = boolean types
- You can get a data type by using the `type()` function
	- For example
- you can specify a data type with casting
	- for example `x = str(10)` or `y = int("3")` or `z = float(3)`
	The resulting output would be x=10 y=3 and z=3.0
- Strings can be defined with either a single or double quote `"`
- A variable is a format used to set a definition to data i.e. `v = 2 or v = python`
	- you can change variable types i.e. `int()` ---> `str()`  or `str()` ----> `int()`
	- Variable Names are Case Sensitive so Capitalization does matter.
