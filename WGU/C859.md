# Introduction to Programming in Python - C859

- A program has 2 instructions the processing instruction and the output instruction
- `#` or comment explains code and is not read by the program, it allows code to be more human readable you can use `#` or `"""`
- Data types can be
	- Built-in
	- `str()` (string) = Text
	- `int()` (integer),  `float()` (float) = numeric
	- `list()`(list), `tuple()`(tuple), `range()`(range) = sequence
	- `bool()`(boolean) = boolean types
- You can get a data type by using the `type()` function
	- For example
- you can specify a data type with casting
	- for example `x = str(10)` or `y = int("3")` or `z = float(3)`
	The resulting output would be x=10 y=3 and z=3.0
- Strings can be defined with either a single or double quote `"`
- A variable is a format used to set a definition to data i.e. `v = 2 or v = python`
	- you can change variable types i.e. `int()` ---> `str()`  or `str()` ----> `int()`
	- Variable Names are Case Sensitive so Capitalization does matter.
- Numbers are expressed as
	- int - positive or negative whole number. it cannot contain decimals
	- float -positive or negative and must contain at least one decimal
- Strings are anything surrounded by single or double quotes
	- Multi-line strings are defined with 3 single or double quotes at the beginning and end of the sting
- Python does not have a count data type. to accomplish this simply take a string and add a number in brackets
	```
	description = ("result = ")
	a = ("hello")

	Print(description)
	Print(a[1])

	# results after running the command
	result =
	e
	# we get a result of e instead of h because h actually holds a place value of "0"

	```

-  Booleans represent true or false
```
print("result for 10 is greater than 9")

print(10 > 9)

print("result for 10 is equal to 9")

print(10 == 9)

print("result for 10 is less than 9")

print(10 < 9)

# Results after running the above command
result for 10 is greater than 9
True

result for 10 is equal to 9
False

result for 10 is less than 9
False

```

- If Statements
```
a = 100
b = 50

if b > a:
	print("b is greater than a")
else:
	print("b is not greater than a")

# Results after running the above command

b is not greater than a
```

- Bool function.
```
print(bool("Hello"))

print(bool(15))

# Results after running the above command
True
True
```
	- Almost all values are true:
		- strings are true except empty strings
		- any number is true except for the number 0
		- Lists, Truples, and Sets are true unless they are black/empty

- Operators - perform operations on variables
	- `+` for addition
	- `-` for subtraction
	- `*` for multiplication
	- `%` for modulus
	-  Assignment Operators
		- x += 3 or x = x + 3 (SAME)
		- x -= 3 or x = x - 3 (SAME)
	- Comparator Operators
		- `==` for Equal to
		- `>=` for Greater than or equal to
		- `<=` for less than or equal to
- Lists
	- Multiple items in 1 variable
	- Built-in Data types
	- used to store collections of data
	- created using `[]`
	- `list = "apples", "bananas", "oranges"` ( this list also has an index apples=0 bananas=1 etc)
```
list = ["apples", "bananas", "oranges"]

print(list)

print(len(list))

Print("Items")

# Results of the above command
"apples", "bananas", "oranges"
This list contains
3
Items

```

- Tuples
	- Multiple items in 1 variable
	- Built-in Data type
	- Used to store collections of data
