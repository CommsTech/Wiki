# Cloud Deployment and Operations - C924
# Metrics, Logs, Alarms, and Tracking

### CloudWatch
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Status Pager
**Use this to**  - Get alerts about AWS services messing up or disconnecting.
**It's like**  - PagerDuty, Statuspage

Amazon Cloudwatch
-   collect
-   monitor
-   act
-   visualize
-   explore
-   analyze

Amazon Cloudwatch Components
-   Metrics
-   Logs
-   Alarms
-   Service Lens
-   Insights
-   Synthetics

Cloudwatch Data

1!Metrics - Quantitative Assessments

Logs - Records of events

Amazon Cloudwatch EC2 Metrics - (Under the monitoring tab)

A detailed monitor must be enabled if an alarm is to trigger in under 5 mins.

A Cloudwatch alarm monitors a metric, and when defined thresholds are met or exceeded the alarm triggers an action.

You can create a Cloudwatch dashboard to display custom metrics by adding a widget and choosing metrics from the custom namespace.

Utilization data is not recorded in log files in Cloudwatch logs.

To store logs of terminated instances you must configure a unified Cloudwatch agent to stream the logs to Cloudwatch logs. this will ensure all logs are up to date at the point of termination.

VPC flow logs can be enabled on either the NAT Gateway ENI or the VPC. Cloudwatch insights can then be used to filter data based on source IP

Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. There the access logs should be recorded in a separate, dedicated bucket. Access logs include information such as requests, the remote IP, and the Bucket being accessed.

### SNS
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Messenger
**Use this to**   - Send mobile notifications, emails and/or SMS messages
**It's like**   - UrbanAirship, Twilio

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) - provides a serverless publication/subscription platform for messaging

Simple Notification Server (SNS) supports the following subscription protocols

-   Kinesis Firehose
-   Amazon SQS (simple queuing service)
-   Aws Lambda
-   Email
-   HTTP(S) endpoints
-   Platform application endpoints
-   SMS (simple messaging service)

For a rate-based rule, enter the max number of requests to allow in any 5 minutes from an IP that matches the rule condition

### SES

**Should have been called**  - Amazon Transactional Email
**Use this to**  - Send one-off emails like password resets, notifications, etc. You could use it to send a newsletter if you wrote all the code, but that's not a great idea.
**It's like**  - SendGrid, Mandrill, Postmark

### SQS
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Queue
**Use this to**  - Store data for future processing in a queue. The lingo for this is storing "messages" but it doesn't have anything to do with email or SMS. SQS doesn't have any logic, it's just a place to put things and take things out.
**It's like**  - RabbitMQ, Sidekiq


### Amazon Athena
**Should have been called** - Serverless Lookup
**Use this to** - Query services and analyze data in amazon S3.

Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that makes it easy to analyze large amounts of data stored in an Amazon S3 Using standard SQL.

Using Athena with cloudtrail logs is a powerful way to enhance your analysis of AWS service activity. for example you can use queries to identify trends and further isolate activity by attributes, such as source IP address or user.

The Amazon Inspector agent is an entity that collects installed package information and software configurations for an EC2 instance.

to determine whether a log file was modified, deleted, or unchanged after cloudtrail delivered it you can use cloudtrail log files integrity validation


### CloudTrail
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Logging
**Use this to**  - Log who is doing what in your AWS stack (API calls).

For an alarm to go off when there are no healthy instances the “HealthyHostCount” metric is < = 0

#### Cloudtrail Setup

Step 1 - Choose trail attributes

![](cloudtrail_step1.png)

![](cloudtrail_step1_1.png)

![](cloudtrail_step1_2.png)

Step 2 - Choose the Log Events

![](cloudtrail_step2.png)

**Note Click “Exclude AWS KMS events” to exclude KMS events. without this clicked it can be a bit noisy in the logs**

Step 3 - Review and Create

### Lambda
**Should have been called** - AWS App Scripts
**Use this to** - Run little self contained snippets of JS, Java or Python to do discrete tasks. Sort of a combination of a queue and execution in one. Used for storing and then executing changes to your AWS setup or responding to events in S3 or DynamoDB.
Compute Savings plans should be used when lambda usage is required


### Amazon EventBridge
**Previously called CloudWatch Events**
**Should have been called** - Serverless data connector
**Use this to** - Connect apps with data from sources

Receives an event, applies a rule, and routes event to a target

![[Amazon_EventBridge.png]]


# Storage
## Storage Platforms
### EC2
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Virtual Servers
**Use this to**  - Host the bits of things you think of as a computer.
**It's like**  - It's handwavy, but EC2 instances are similar to the virtual private servers you'd get at Linode, DigitalOcean or Rackspace.

- “AWSSupport-TroubleshootSSH” installs the amazon EC2 Rescue tool and then checks for and corrects some issues that cause remote connection errors.
- EC2 Status checks do not tell you the status of an EBS volume

Troubleshooting EC2 Instances
-   Verify CodeDeploy agent is installed and running on the instance
-   Verify the correct IAM instance profile is attached to the instance
-   Verify the tags are set properly

### S3
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Unlimited FTP Server
**Use this to**  - Store images and other assets for websites. Keep backups and share files between services. Host static websites. Also, many of the other AWS services write and read from S3.

- S3 Glacier Vault lock allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 glacier vaults with a vault lock policy.
- To restrict access to content in an S3 bucket whilst caching it globally Cloudfront can be used with an OAI. The Origin Access Identity is a special user created in CloudFront that is allowed to access the bucket through bucket permissions.

#### S3 Versioning
- Versioning is enabled and suspended at the bucket level, and is a means to keep multiple variants of an object
- Once versioning is enabled on a bucket, it can never be disabled; however, the bucket owner can suspend versioning
- Versioning state applies to all objects in the bucket
- Enabling versioning will give ==NEW== objects added a unique version ID
- Exhisting objects will have a version ID of null and then get a unique version ID when modified in the future.
- Users can experiance 503 errors when submitting a put request beacuse there are millions of versions of objects in the bucket and S3 is throttling the requests

#### S3 Storage Lifecycle
- used to store objects cost-efficently throughout their lifecycle by:
	- Trasitioning the object
		- Objects must be stored for a minimum of 30 days in standard storage before they can be transitioned
		- Cannot transition ==FROM== any storage calss ==TO== S3 Standard storage
	- Expiring the object
![[Amazon_S3_Storage_Classes.png]]

#### S3 Cross-region replication
- allows you to store data closer to your users
- allows you to store data closer to your compute resources
- porvides compliance
- Replication requires versioning to be enabled for the destination bucket

##### What gets replicated
- Objects added to a bucket after replication is configured
- Object metadata and tags
- Objects where bucket owner persmissions to read objects and ACLs
- Unencrypted objects
- Objects encrypted at rest under S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) or Customer master Keys (CMKs) stored in AWS key management Service (SSE-KMS)

##### What does NOT get replicated
- Objects that existed prior to configuring replicaiton
	- to do this contact AWS Support
- Objects where the bucket owner does not have permissions
- Objects that are stored in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacer Deep Archive storage class
- Objects created with server-sider encryption using customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)

##### Event Notifications
- S3 Generated notificsations triggred by specific events
- Targets can be SNS, SQS or Lamda
- Several predefined events by AWS for you to choose from
- Events are delivered in an "at least once" fashion (potential to recieve duplicate events)
- create custome filters usinge key prefix's

### Elasticache
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Memcached
**Use this to**  - Be your app's Memcached or Redis.
**It's like**   - Redis to Go, Memcachier

- With Amazon ElasticCache Memcached engine you cannot modify the node type. the way to scale up is to create a new cluster and specify the new node type. you can update the endpoint config in your application to point to the new endpoint.

- When using a single shard with cluster mode disabled you can create up to 5 replicas and the replicas can be in separate AZ as this adds High Availability with auto-failover.

### Memcached
Memcached is fast, multi-threaded, and designed for simplicity

### Redis
Stands for Remote Dictionary server
Redis Supports snapshots, replication, and transactions

### RDS
**Should have been called**  -  Amazon SQL
**Use this to** - Be your app's Mysql, Postgres, and Oracle database.
**It's like**  - Heroku Postgres

RDS handles failovers automatically. the primary DB will automatically switch to the standby replica if any of the following occur

-   An AZ Outage
-   The Primary DB instance Fails
-   The DB instances server type is changed
-   The OS of the DB instance is undergoing patching
-   a manual failover of the DB instance was initiated using “Reboot with Failover”

RDS service includes backups, patching, failover detection, and recovery

RDS Multi-AZ Failover occurs in the following situations

-   An Availability zone outage
-   The primary DB instance fails
-   The DB instance type is changed
-   the OS of the DB instance is undergoing patching
-   A Manual failover of the DB instance was initiated using a reboot

The Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides a filesystem interface to connect multiple AZ to a single filesystem using the NFS protocol

After creating a cluster, you can immediately run queries by using the query editor on the amazon redshift console. One of the limitations of the cluster query editor is that you cannot use it with enhanced VPC routing

The Following are a few reasons why an instance might immediately terminate

-   You’ve reached your EBS Volume limit
-   An EBS snapshot is corrupt
-   The root EBS volume is encrypted and you don’t have permission to access the key
-   The instance store-backed AMI that you used to launch the instance is missing a required part.

There are two ways to scale a database when you need the capacity to serve reads.

1.  Use a read replica
2.  Modify the RDS instance type to a larger instance.

The AWS config encrypted-volumes rule checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted

You can run volume gateways in two modes Cached and Stored. With cached volumes, the storage gateway service stores full volume in its S3 service bucket and a portion of the volume (recently accessed) in the gateway local cache

You can scale Elasticcache and Memcached clusters horizontally or vertically.

Amazon S3 inventory provides CSV output files that list your objects and their corresponding metadata on a daily or weekly basis for an S3 bucket or a shared prefix. The inventory reports will provide a definitive answer to the admin for how many objects are in a bucket.

To add HA to an existing RDS instance go into the console and enable multi-AZ

to share a snapshot with another account you must create a manual RDS snapshot with the create-db-snapshot command and share it to the destined account. then they create a copy of their account.

Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your Database instances during the backup window of your instance.

Amazon RDS provides metrics in real-time for the OS that your DB instance runs on. you can view the metric for your DB instance using the console. Enhanced monitoring JSON output from Cloudwatch logs in a monitoring system of your choice.


### Backup and Restore Strategies

![](backup_features_of_aws.png)

RPO - Recovery point Objective (Data Loss)

RTO - Recovery Time Objective (Down Time)

![](rpovrto.png)

Data Lifecycle manager (for EBS Only)
- Under the EC2 Management Plane

AWS Backup (Multiple services)

##### Database restoration options
- Restoring to a point in time
	- Creates a new database instance
	- Recommended to choose the same or similar database instace size
	-  AWS Backup can also be used to restore an RDS database to a point in time
- Restoring from a database snapshot
	- Creates a new database instance
	- You ==CANNOT== restore from a snapshot that is both shared and encrypted
		- Instead, create a copy of the snapshot and restore from the copy
	- you ==CAN== restore from a snapshot and choose a diffrent storage type
- Promoting a read replica
	- When promoting a read replica, the database instance is rebooted
	- After promoting, it is the same as any other database instance

##### Disaster recovery options
![[Disaster_Recovery_Options.png]]



### Amazon Aurora 
**Should have been called** - 
**Use this to** - 
**It's like** - 

Aurora uses database clusters

- Backups 
	- cluster volume backed up automatically during a daily preferred backup window
	- Retains restore data for the backup retention period (Defaults to 1 day)
	- Backups are continous and incremental
	- Manual snapshots are possible, and you can create a new database cluster from a snapshot
- Restore
	- Create a new database cluster from a backup or a snapshot
	- can restore to any period of time in the backup retention period
	- can also cone a database from one cluster to another
- Backtracking
	- Feature must be enabled when the database cluster is created
	- "Rewinds" the database cluster to a time you specify
		- Allows you to immediantly undo a destructive action
	- Does NOT require a new database cluster and rewind happens within minutes
	- Can use this repeatedly back and forth
	- backtrack window is linited to 72 hours

### Snowball
**Should have been called**  - AWS Big Old Portable Storage
**Use this to**  - Get a bunch of hard drives you can attach to your network to make getting large amounts (Terabytes of Data) into and out of AWS
**It's like**  - Shipping a Network Attached Storage device to AWS

### Glacier

**It's like** - Heroku, Capistrano

# Networking
________________________________
## Firewalls

a stateful firewall allows return traffic automatically

a stateless firewall checks for an allow rule for both connections (in and out)

### WAF
**Should have been called**  - AWS Firewall
**Use this to**  - Block bad requests to Cloudfront protected sites (aka stop people trying 10,000 passwords against /wp-admin)

## DNS
### Route53
**Should have been called** - Amazon DNS + Domains
**Use this to** - Buy a new domain and set up the DNS records for that domain.
**It's like** - DNSimple, GoDaddy, Gandi

Route 53 doesn’t charge for alias queries to AWS resources

## CDN
### Amazon Cloudfront
**Should have been called** - Amazon CDN
**Use this to**  - Make your websites load faster by spreading out static file delivery to be closer to where your users are.
**It's like**  - MaxCDN, Akamai

Amazon CloudFront can be used to cache static content from the S3 Bucket. this helps improve performance for the delivery of static content. Adding an auto-scaling group to the solution will enable the web servers to scale based on demand

## L2 VLANs
### VPC (Virtual Private Cluters)
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Virtual Colocated Rack
**Use this to**  - Overcome objections that "all our stuff is on the internet!" by adding an additional layer of security. Makes it appear as if all of your AWS services are on the same little network instead of being small pieces in a much bigger network.
**It's like** - If you're familar with networking: VLANs

Inter-Region VPC peering provides a simple and cost-effective way to share resources between regions or replicate data for geographic redundancy.

A 503 service unavailable error is most likely caused by too many requests in a short period of time.

AWS config restricted-common-ports check is used to check whether security groups in use do not allow unrestricted TCP traffic to specific ports

By default, you can only have up to 5 non-default VPCs per AWS account

## Load Balancers
### Elastic Load Balancer
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) provides access logs that capture detailed info about requests to your load balancer

### Application Load Balancer
An Application load balancer will block malformed requests that do not meet the HTTP specification with a 400 bad request error

## Gateways
### NAT Gateways
NAT gateways provide outbound internet connectivity it does not provide inbound access.

A NAT Gateway provides internet connectivity to instances in private subnets. It performs Network address translation so that the source IP is translated to an internet routable IP address.

### Internet Gateways
You need to shutdown your VM for maintenance but before you do you must stop the gateway and then reboot/shutdown

An egress-only internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from your VPC

### API Gateway
**Should have been called**  - API Proxy
**Use this to**  - Proxy your apps API through this so you can throttle bad client traffic, test new versions, and present methods more cleanly.
**It's like**  - 3Scale

https://status.aws.amazon.com


### AWS Organizations

AWS Organization features

-   AWS Organization provides account consolidation and management service
-   Hierarchical groupings of your aws accounts
-   Provides consolidated billing: root member account pays for the member accounts
-   Enable services and features across the organization
-   Service Control Policys (SCPs) allow granular allows/denies of api actions

In AWS Organizations service control policies (SCP) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization

The SSM Agent must be installed on the instances you want to connect to through sessions a custom AMI may not have an SSM agent installed and an administrator may need to install it. By default, SSM doesn’t have permission to perform actions on your instances.

For a workflow to open the AWS management console on behalf of a user AWS SSO endpoint is required instead of directly calling the AssumeRole with SAML API. The endpoint calls the API for the user and returns a URL that automatically redirects the users browser to the AWS management console.

AD Connector is designed to give you an easy way to establish a trust relationship between your active directory and AWS.

The “AMI ID does not exist” indicates that the AMI might have been deleted after creating the launch config. As it is not possible to update the launch configs, a new config must be created with a valid AMI.

AWS system manager parameter store provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management


### IAM - Identity and access manager
**Should have been called**  - Users, Keys and Certs
**Use this to** - Set up additional users, set up new AWS Keys and policies.

IAM is a web service that helps you control access to your cloud resources

Allows Granular control for both access and authorization

IAM users are global users and user accounts can be used globally

IAM Best Practices

-   Enable MFA
-   Set Password policies
-   User roles over IAM users. Roles provide a more temporary access
-   implement least privilege
-   Validate IAM Policies Regularly
-   Always use roles for resources

The “Rollback\_Complete” status indicates successful removal of one or more stacks after a failed stack creation

A “Stack Set” lets you create stacks in AWS accounts across regions by using a single cloud formation template

You can use the optional parameters section to customize your templates. Parameters enable you to input custom values to your templates each time you create or update a stack.

Cloudformation change sets allows you to preview how proposed changes to a stack might impact your currently running resources.

Stack- A collection of resources to deploy as a group
Template - A JSON or YAML File that describes the stack
Change Set - Preview/Summary of proposed changes and how they will impact currently running resources
Stackset - Create, Update, delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions. (Stacks that live across multiple accounts using the same template)
Nested Stacks- stacks created as part of other stacks. (Stacks that are contained within a Parent Stack)

Options for Sequencing and Dependencies

## Tips and Tricks
Completion of C924 requires you to pass the AWS SysOps Associate certification. I found this to be one of the hardest classes at WGU, but looking back at it I honestly may have worked it up to be more than it was and stressed out about it waaaay more than I needed to. Don't make my same mistake! I had zero AWS experience, but was able to pass on the first attempt.

I started by reading around on what others did to pass the class. A consistent theme among many people, whether it was on Chatter or on Reddit, was this class was the hardest they had ever taken, or they were on their third attempt and were having a lot of issues. I honestly started to freak out a bit before I even started the class, and I was stressing a lot about it as I was studying which definitely didn't help. I got sick twice in a one month period, and I'm almost certain that stress from this class contributed to that. I want to emphasize again that my stress was misplaced. This class is 100% doable, you just need to be ready for the long haul. It took me about a month and a half to finish this class (everyone work at your own pace, but this was long for me). If you are near the end of your semester I would keep in mind that it may be a longer class, so be ready to finish it in the next semester or even wait to take it and work on something else that may be shorter.

**BACKGROUND EXPERIENCE:**

I did have to take C849 (Cloud Foundations) before this class, so I did hold the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner cert. This cert is really just a high level introduction to all AWS services, and I feel this didn't contribute much other than to familiarize me with AWS services.

I do have some experience in Azure and around 3-4 years of IT experience in the field, but the SysOps cert is very specific to AWS. I'll explain more below, but it requires specific knowledge in specific situations with AWS services.

**RESOURCES USED:**

I relied heavily on this post, but I'll detail resources below and my thoughts about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/ko0m1q/c924_cloud_deployment_and_operations_class_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/ko0m1q/c924_cloud_deployment_and_operations_class_tips/)

First I started out using Stephane Mareek's udemy course. This is a very long course (25 hours) but free with WGU sign in. He has added videos for the v2 version of the test and as the AWS portal has updated. I watched ALL these videos (at 1.25 speed) and took notes. I needed to pause every now and then to finish writing the note. With every resource, he gives a nice bulleted list of what you need to know and how it applies. Some other posts say this course is too high level, but I feel he touches on the specific "gotchya's" that you need to know for the exam. It also has a practice test at the end of the course.

Aws.training/aws skillbuilder does have a training video that is part of the official curriculum. Its pretty short (1.5 hours). It does a pretty good job at outlining how to select the correct answer and throw out the incorrect "distractor" answers. It has practice questions embedded into the video. If you are looking for more practice, you can go through the video and pause before the answer is given.

Neal Davis practice exams on Udemy (4 exams, free with WGU, no lecture content). Some of these questions are outdated, but it has pretty good explanations for incorrect questions. I think this was extremely beneficial to my study. I saw many questions that were **VERY SIMILAIR** to questions on the real test, or at least helped me to know what the question was asking on the real test and what the expected answer was.

Lastly, Pluralsight's Demystifying AWS Sysops Exam (1.5 hours, free with WGU log in). I used this before the test to summarize and review everything. This course didn't go into much detail, but was good at high level explaining why certain AWS resources were important. This video also has a couple (fairly easy) example questions that boosted my confidence in my abilities a bit.

**STUDY METHOD/PRACTICE TESTS:**

First I watched through Stephane's course on Udemy. I mentioned it above, but I took a bunch of notes (and kind of wasted a lot of paper, but writhing things down helps me retain information). Each section also had a practice test that I would take until I could score like 80% or 90% on. 2 or 3 weeks later when I finally finished the course I took the practice exam in his course and got a 47%. Oof...I was a little shocked to do this trashy on the first test, but I expected it after reading other reviews. I went through all my incorrect answers and wrote down the explanation in my notebook, and took the test again and got an 81%. I don't know how much retaking the test actually helps since by that point I mostly have the answers memorized, but if you go at it the right way and reason with yourself for all the questions it does help out.

I then took the first Neal Davis practice exam and got a 58%. Yikes...still trash but at least a bit better. I did the same thing as above and retook it and got a 93%.

I then watched through the AWS Skill builder video. I did fairly well on the practice questions. I didn't actually take notes on this though looking back on it I probably should have.

In a day or two I took the second Neal Davis practice exam and scored a 70%. Grr...not a pass but still pretty good. I'm kicking myself because this is the point when I got more stressed out about it after spending all this time, just to still fail. I was around this time I got pretty sick and wasn't able to get much done with balancing work and school and rest, but I wish I had realized 70% was good. I did the same thing above and reviewed all the questions, took notes, read up a bit on what I missed, and re-took the exam and scored a 98%.

I took the third Neal Davis and scored 70% again. I was a little concerned at this point...I should have done better. Again...same thing as above. Wrote notes on what I missed, re-took and got an 86%.

I then took the 4th (and last) Neal Davis practice exam and scored a 63%. Oh crap! Honestly, at this point I was pretty fed up with the class and decided I would take the high stakes exam even though I had a feeling I wouldn't pass. If I didn't pass, I decided I would buy the Tutorial Dojo practice exams to help study some more. For the 4th practice exam, I did the same thing again and re-took and scored an 89%.

A couple days later I watched the Pluralsight course to kind of sum things up, and then scheduled the actual exam for the same day. I didn't take any notes, but I did pause the video and answer the questions to help practice a final bit.

**EXAM EXPERIENCE aka THA REAL DEAL:**

Honestly, this was one of the worse testing experiences I had with PearsonVUE at home, but it could have been partially my fault. My home internet connection (garbage DSL) had been extra slow and unreliable lately, so I decided to run the test off my phone hotspot. They had changed the check in process a bit and when I took pictures of my workspace it used the zoomed long range camera on my phone so I could get barely any of my desk in the picture without my back to the limits of the room. It also took a really long time to upload all the pictures and I had to retry once or twice. The test froze on a loading screen when I was in the multiple choice section, and I had to hit Ctrl + Alt + Del to close the test and had to get re-admitted into the test. This wasn't a big issue for the proctors, but still stressing for me. On the 3rd (last) lab, I completed the requirements and as I was about to hit submit the test got stuck on another connecting screen that reported it had issues connecting to the virtual environment, and to contact a test administrator. I tried to chat with a proctor but no one came (grr, this annoyed me most; it really seems like the proctors can't really do anything to help you other than release the test). I did the same thing and got re-admitted to the test. Luckily, all my progress was there but I was crapping myself for a couple minutes. I submitted right away before I had more issues.

Anyways, enough complaining. As for the content of the test, it was, again, VERY SIMILAIR to the practice tests. To the extent of although the wording was of course different, I knew what the question was asking and what the content of the answer would _probably_ include before I was done reading the prompt.

A lot of questions boil down to what is the recommended or "best practice" way to do it, and what answer matches that closest.

Many involve looking at a Security Group, ACL Configuration, or Address Table, and figuring out why something cant talk to something else, or preventing the internet or something in particular to talk to something.

Other questions boil down to "hey dummy, this won't work because of that" (if that makes any sense...some things just work one way).

A generic example I feel I can give: A question may give a situation that requires an ElasticSearch solution, and the question may ask how to fulfill these requirements. AWS recommends three dedicated master nodes (or an odd number), so if one fails the cluster can always have a "master" and a "backup." If the cluster cant have a "backup," AWS may blow up. This is a joke of course since I didn't take the time to fully understand why, but I know that having an odd number of nodes is "best practice," so the answer has to be the one with an odd number of nodes. Read up more on this here: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains-dedicatedmasternodes.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains-dedicatedmasternodes.html)

Other situations include something like:

-   Using a Security Role or Group is more secure (and better IT practice in general) than sharing an account or embedding credentials in a script.
    
-   Route 53, knowing when you can use Alias vs CNAME records.
    
-   If you want to use a bucket as a static website, it must have the same name as the domain and security groups configured correct
    
-   Generally the most "outward facing service" will hold the logs for a service. If you are trying to trace HTTP logs for a bucket behind a CloudFront distribution, the logs will be in CloudWatch logs.
    
-   Are the logs for so and so in CloudWatch, CloudTrail, AWS Config, or etc?
    
-   Ugh. Stacks, Stack Sets, Embedded Stacks, or maybe just create a whole new stack bro.
    
-   Change Sets, AWS Config, AWS Organizations
    
-   AMI names are not shared among all regions
    
-   Look at this config for this security group or whatever, what is allowed to access what.
    

**LABS - ENTERING THE SIMULATION:**

The labs are literally in a windows virtual machine in some DC somewhere and completing the required tasks in Google Chrome. Despite me being on a mobile connection, the latency wasn't too bad so I assume the test will find some DC near you (Cough cough...Route 53 geolocation routing maybe). The browser is locked down to only AWS console, so you can't google stuff of course. To get credit, don't "Log Out" of your virtual machine. Just click submit for the question within the PearsonVue software. On the right hand side of your window will list the instructions. The important fields with unique names are copy-able, so you can just use Ctrl+V to past it in your VM. If that doesn't work for some reason, the instructions are also on the desktop in a text file so you could manually right click if needed.

Aight, imma be honest. These were not too difficult. Maybe I got lucky and got questions that were not difficult? I was the most stressed out and definitely the most unprepared for these. Again, I have 0 hand on experience, let alone even touching the AWS console. I had seen it in the Stephane videos so I knew what it looked like, but had never done anything in it.

A couple of things to note:

-   I had plenty of time, even after all the multiple choice. I wasn't scared of running out of time.
    
-   I had a feeling I did pretty well on the multiple choice, so I knew I could take a hit here if needed.
    
-   If something isn't in green as a field you could copy to your clipboard...I suspect its not very important since they aren't giving you a specific name for it.
    

I had to do a lot of clicking around and a couple delete/recreate/refresh/wtf-hand-at-computer-screen to get things to work, but honestly props to the designers of the AWS Console. Its pretty intuitive. The prompt pretty much gave you the steps to follow in the order it would appear to you, and all you had to do is past the correct information in the correct spot. If something didn't appear when according to the steps it should appear, I knew I had missed something or wasn't in the correct spot. Just don't lose your marbles here and you should do fine.

Don't do what I did though. I would recommend following along with Stephane for the things that are free (he will give you warnings for things that incur costs). Just have a general idea of where things are and how the AWS console works

**ENDING THOUGHTS & TL;DR**

At the end of the day, I passed with a 743 (720 needed for passing). Definitely not a high score, but a pass is a pass.

If you read even partially through this post, you can finish this course! Don't lose your marbles and stress about it and get sick...like me. The practice exams are definitely harder for the real deal, but they really prepared me for the test.

If you are looking for extra practice, Tutorial Dojo's practice exams are highly recommended on other posts: [https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/). I was honestly just being stubborn and didn't want to spend extra money.

Be familiar with the AWS console, but don't stress yourself about taking the labs
