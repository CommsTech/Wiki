# Metrics, Logs, Alarms, and Tracking

### CloudWatch
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Status Pager
**Use this to**  - Get alerts about AWS services messing up or disconnecting.
**It's like**  - PagerDuty, Statuspage

Amazon Cloudwatch
-   collect
-   monitor
-   act
-   visualize
-   explore
-   analyze

Amazon Cloudwatch Components
-   Metrics
-   Logs
-   Alarms
-   Service Lens
-   Insights
-   Synthetics

Cloudwatch Data

1!Metrics - Quantitative Assessments

Logs - Records of events

Amazon Cloudwatch EC2 Metrics - (Under the monitoring tab)

A detailed monitor must be enabled if an alarm is to trigger in under 5 mins.

A Cloudwatch alarm monitors a metric, and when defined thresholds are met or exceeded the alarm triggers an action.

You can create a Cloudwatch dashboard to display custom metrics by adding a widget and choosing metrics from the custom namespace.

Utilization data is not recorded in log files in Cloudwatch logs.

To store logs of terminated instances you must configure a unified Cloudwatch agent to stream the logs to Cloudwatch logs. this will ensure all logs are up to date at the point of termination.

VPC flow logs can be enabled on either the NAT Gateway ENI or the VPC. Cloudwatch insights can then be used to filter data based on source IP

Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. There the access logs should be recorded in a separate, dedicated bucket. Access logs include information such as requests, the remote IP, and the Bucket being accessed.

### SNS
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Messenger
**Use this to**   - Send mobile notifications, emails and/or SMS messages
**It's like**   - UrbanAirship, Twilio

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) - provides a serverless publication/subscription platform for messaging

Simple Notification Server (SNS) supports the following subscription protocols

-   Kinesis Firehose
-   Amazon SQS (simple queuing service)
-   Aws Lambda
-   Email
-   HTTP(S) endpoints
-   Platform application endpoints
-   SMS (simple messaging service)

For a rate-based rule, enter the max number of requests to allow in any 5 minutes from an IP that matches the rule condition

### SES

**Should have been called**  - Amazon Transactional Email
**Use this to**  - Send one-off emails like password resets, notifications, etc. You could use it to send a newsletter if you wrote all the code, but that's not a great idea.
**It's like**  - SendGrid, Mandrill, Postmark

### SQS
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Queue
**Use this to**  - Store data for future processing in a queue. The lingo for this is storing "messages" but it doesn't have anything to do with email or SMS. SQS doesn't have any logic, it's just a place to put things and take things out.
**It's like**  - RabbitMQ, Sidekiq


### Amazon Athena
**Should have been called** - Serverless Lookup
**Use this to** - Query services and analyze data in amazon S3.

Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that makes it easy to analyze large amounts of data stored in an Amazon S3 Using standard SQL.

Using Athena with cloudtrail logs is a powerful way to enhance your analysis of AWS service activity. for example you can use queries to identify trends and further isolate activity by attributes, such as source IP address or user.

The Amazon Inspector agent is an entity that collects installed package information and software configurations for an EC2 instance.

to determine whether a log file was modified, deleted, or unchanged after cloudtrail delivered it you can use cloudtrail log files integrity validation


### CloudTrail
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Logging
**Use this to**  - Log who is doing what in your AWS stack (API calls).

For an alarm to go off when there are no healthy instances the “HealthyHostCount” metric is < = 0

#### Cloudtrail Setup

Step 1 - Choose trail attributes

![](cloudtrail_step1.png)

![](cloudtrail_step1_1.png)

![](cloudtrail_step1_2.png)

Step 2 - Choose the Log Events

![](cloudtrail_step2.png)

**Note Click “Exclude AWS KMS events” to exclude KMS events. without this clicked it can be a bit noisy in the logs**

Step 3 - Review and Create

### Lambda
**Should have been called** - AWS App Scripts
**Use this to** - Run little self contained snippets of JS, Java or Python to do discrete tasks. Sort of a combination of a queue and execution in one. Used for storing and then executing changes to your AWS setup or responding to events in S3 or DynamoDB.
Compute Savings plans should be used when lambda usage is required

# Storage
### EC2
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Virtual Servers
**Use this to**  - Host the bits of things you think of as a computer.
**It's like**  - It's handwavy, but EC2 instances are similar to the virtual private servers you'd get at Linode, DigitalOcean or Rackspace.

- “AWSSupport-TroubleshootSSH” installs the amazon EC2 Rescue tool and then checks for and corrects some issues that cause remote connection errors.
- EC2 Status checks do not tell you the status of an EBS volume

Troubleshooting EC2 Instances
-   Verify CodeDeploy agent is installed and running on the instance
-   Verify the correct IAM instance profile is attached to the instance
-   Verify the tags are set properly

### S3
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Unlimited FTP Server
**Use this to**  - Store images and other assets for websites. Keep backups and share files between services. Host static websites. Also, many of the other AWS services write and read from S3.

- S3 Glacier Vault lock allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 glacier vaults with a vault lock policy.
- To restrict access to content in an S3 bucket whilst caching it globally Cloudfront can be used with an OAI. The Origin Access Identity is a special user created in CloudFront that is allowed to access the bucket through bucket permissions.

#### S3 Versioning
- Versioning is enabled and suspended at the bucket level, and is a means to keep multiple variants of an object
- Once versioning is enabled on a bucket, it can never be disabled; however, the bucket owner can suspend versioning
- Versioning state applies to all objects in the bucket
- Enabling versioning will give ==NEW== objects added a unique version ID
- Exhisting objects will have a version ID of null and then get a unique version ID when modified in the future.
- Users can experiance 503 errors when submitting a put request beacuse there are millions of versions of objects in the bucket and S3 is throttling the requests

#### S3 Storage Lifecycle
- used to store objects cost-efficently throughout their lifecycle by:
	- Trasitioning the object
		- Objects must be stored for a minimum of 30 days in standard storage before they can be transitioned
		- Cannot transition ==FROM== any storage calss ==TO== S3 Standard storage
	- Expiring the object
![[Pasted image 20220724160009.png]]

#### S3 Cross-region replication
- allows you to store data closer to your users
- allows you to store data closer to your compute resources
- porvides compliance
- Replication requires versioning to be enabled for the destination bucket

##### What gets replicated
- Objects added to a bucket after replication is configured
- Object metadata and tags
- Objects where bucket owner persmissions to read objects and ACLs
- Unencrypted objects
- Objects encrypted at rest under S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) or Customer master Keys (CMKs) stored in AWS key management Service (SSE-KMS)

##### What does ==NOT== get replicated
- Objects that existed prior to configuring replicaiton
	- to do this contact AWS Support
- Objects where the bucket owner does not have permissions
- Objects that are stored in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacer Deep Archive storage class
- Objects created with server-sider encryption using customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)

### Elasticache
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Memcached
**Use this to**  - Be your app's Memcached or Redis.
**It's like**   - Redis to Go, Memcachier

- With Amazon ElasticCache Memcached engine you cannot modify the node type. the way to scale up is to create a new cluster and specify the new node type. you can update the endpoint config in your application to point to the new endpoint.

- When using a single shard with cluster mode disabled you can create up to 5 replicas and the replicas can be in separate AZ as this adds High Availability with auto-failover.

### Memcached
Memcached is fast, multi-threaded, and designed for simplicity

### Redis
Stands for Remote Dictionary server
Redis Supports snapshots, replication, and transactions

### RDS
**Should have been called**  -  Amazon SQL
**Use this to** - Be your app's Mysql, Postgres, and Oracle database.
**It's like**  - Heroku Postgres

RDS handles failovers automatically. the primary DB will automatically switch to the standby replica if any of the following occur

-   An AZ Outage
-   The Primary DB instance Fails
-   The DB instances server type is changed
-   The OS of the DB instance is undergoing patching
-   a manual failover of the DB instance was initiated using “Reboot with Failover”

RDS service includes backups, patching, failover detection, and recovery

RDS Multi-AZ Failover occurs in the following situations

-   An Availability zone outage
-   The primary DB instance fails
-   The DB instance type is changed
-   the OS of the DB instance is undergoing patching
-   A Manual failover of the DB instance was initiated using a reboot

The Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides a filesystem interface to connect multiple AZ to a single filesystem using the NFS protocol

After creating a cluster, you can immediately run queries by using the query editor on the amazon redshift console. One of the limitations of the cluster query editor is that you cannot use it with enhanced VPC routing

The Following are a few reasons why an instance might immediately terminate

-   You’ve reached your EBS Volume limit
-   An EBS snapshot is corrupt
-   The root EBS volume is encrypted and you don’t have permission to access the key
-   The instance store-backed AMI that you used to launch the instance is missing a required part.

There are two ways to scale a database when you need the capacity to serve reads.

1.  Use a read replica
2.  Modify the RDS instance type to a larger instance.

The AWS config encrypted-volumes rule checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted

You can run volume gateways in two modes Cached and Stored. With cached volumes, the storage gateway service stores full volume in its S3 service bucket and a portion of the volume (recently accessed) in the gateway local cache

You can scale Elasticcache and Memcached clusters horizontally or vertically.

Amazon S3 inventory provides CSV output files that list your objects and their corresponding metadata on a daily or weekly basis for an S3 bucket or a shared prefix. The inventory reports will provide a definitive answer to the admin for how many objects are in a bucket.

To add HA to an existing RDS instance go into the console and enable multi-AZ

to share a snapshot with another account you must create a manual RDS snapshot with the create-db-snapshot command and share it to the destined account. then they create a copy of their account.

Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your Database instances during the backup window of your instance.

Amazon RDS provides metrics in real-time for the OS that your DB instance runs on. you can view the metric for your DB instance using the console. Enhanced monitoring JSON output from Cloudwatch logs in a monitoring system of your choice.


### Backup and Restore Strategies

![](backup_features_of_aws.png)

RPO - Recovery point Objective (Data Loss)

RTO - Recovery Time Objective (Down Time)

![](rpovrto.png)

Data Lifecycle manager (for EBS Only)
- Under the EC2 Management Plane

AWS Backup (Multiple services)

##### Database restoration options
- Restoring to a point in time
	- Creates a new database instance
	- Recommended to choose the same or similar database instace size
	-  AWS Backup can also be used to restore an RDS database to a point in time
- Restoring from a database snapshot
	- Creates a new database instance
	- You ==CANNOT== restore from a snapshot that is both shared and encrypted
		- Instead, create a copy of the snapshot and restore from the copy
	- you ==CAN== restore from a snapshot and choose a diffrent storage type
- Promoting a read replica
	- When promoting a read replica, the database instance is rebooted
	- After promoting, it is the same as any other database instance

##### Disaster recovery options
![[Pasted image 20220724191520.png]]



### Amazon Aurora 
**Should have been called** - 
**Use this to** - 
**It's like** - 

Aurora uses database clusters

- Backups 
	- cluster volume backed up automatically during a daily preferred backup window
	- Retains restore data for the backup retention period (Defaults to 1 day)
	- Backups are continous and incremental
	- Manual snapshots are possible, and you can create a new database cluster from a snapshot
- Restore
	- Create a new database cluster from a backup or a snapshot
	- can restore to any period of time in the backup retention period
	- can also cone a database from one cluster to another
- Backtracking
	- Feature must be enabled when the database cluster is created
	- "Rewinds" the database cluster to a time you specify
		- Allows you to immediantly undo a destructive action
	- Does NOT require a new database cluster and rewind happens within minutes
	- Can use this repeatedly back and forth
	- backtrack window is linited to 72 hours

### Snowball
**Should have been called**  - AWS Big Old Portable Storage
**Use this to**  - Get a bunch of hard drives you can attach to your network to make getting large amounts (Terabytes of Data) into and out of AWS
**It's like**  - Shipping a Network Attached Storage device to AWS

### Glacier
**Should have been called**  - Really slow Amazon S3
**Use this to**  - Make backups of your backups that you keep on S3. Also, beware the cost of getting data back out in a hurry. For long term archiving.

### CodeCommit
**Should have been called** - Amazon GitHub
**Use this to** - Version control your code - hosted Git.
**It's like** - Github, BitBucket

### Code Deploy

# Networking
________________________________
## Firewalls

a stateful firewall allows return traffic automatically

a stateless firewall checks for an allow rule for both connections (in and out)

### WAF
**Should have been called**  - AWS Firewall
**Use this to**  - Block bad requests to Cloudfront protected sites (aka stop people trying 10,000 passwords against /wp-admin)
**It's like**  - Sophos, Kapersky

## DNS
### Route53
**Should have been called** - Amazon DNS + Domains
**Use this to** - Buy a new domain and set up the DNS records for that domain.
**It's like** - DNSimple, GoDaddy, Gandi

Route 53 doesn’t charge for alias queries to AWS resources

## CDN
### Amazon Cloudfront
**Should have been called** - Amazon CDN
**Use this to**  - Make your websites load faster by spreading out static file delivery to be closer to where your users are.
**It's like**  - MaxCDN, Akamai

Amazon CloudFront can be used to cache static content from the S3 Bucket. this helps improve performance for the delivery of static content. Adding an auto-scaling group to the solution will enable the web servers to scale based on demand

## L2 VLANs
### VPC
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Virtual Colocated Rack
**Use this to**  - Overcome objections that "all our stuff is on the internet!" by adding an additional layer of security. Makes it appear as if all of your AWS services are on the same little network instead of being small pieces in a much bigger network.
**It's like** - If you're familar with networking: VLANs


#### Virtual Private Cluters
Inter-Region VPC peering provides a simple and cost-effective way to share resources between regions or replicate data for geographic redundancy.

A 503 service unavailable error is most likely caused by too many requests in a short period of time.

AWS config restricted-common-ports check is used to check whether security groups in use do not allow unrestricted TCP traffic to specific ports

By default, you can only have up to 5 non-default VPCs per AWS account

## Load Balancers
### Elastic Load Balancer
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) provides access logs that capture detailed info about requests to your load balancer

### Application Load Balancer
An Application load balancer will block malformed requests that do not meet the HTTP specification with a 400 bad request error

## Gateways
### NAT Gateways
NAT gateways provide outbound internet connectivity it does not provide inbound access.

A NAT Gateway provides internet connectivity to instances in private subnets. It performs Network address translation so that the source IP is translated to an internet routable IP address.

### Internet Gateways
You need to shutdown your VM for maintenance but before you do you must stop the gateway and then reboot/shutdown

An egress-only internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from your VPC

### API Gateway
**Should have been called**  - API Proxy
**Use this to**  - Proxy your apps API through this so you can throttle bad client traffic, test new versions, and present methods more cleanly.
**It's like**  - 3Scale

### Storage Gateway
**Should have been called**  - S3 pretending it's part of your corporate network
**Use this to**  - Stop buying more storage to keep Word Docs on. Make automating getting files into S3 from your corporate network easier.

https://status.aws.amazon.com


### AWS Organizations

AWS Organization features

-   AWS Organization provides account consolidation and management service
-   Hierarchical groupings of your aws accounts
-   Provides consolidated billing: root member account pays for the member accounts
-   Enable services and features across the organization
-   Service Control Policys (SCPs) allow granular allows/denies of api actions

In AWS Organizations service control policies (SCP) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization

The SSM Agent must be installed on the instances you want to connect to through sessions a custom AMI may not have an SSM agent installed and an administrator may need to install it. By default, SSM doesn’t have permission to perform actions on your instances.

For a workflow to open the AWS management console on behalf of a user AWS SSO endpoint is required instead of directly calling the AssumeRole with SAML API. The endpoint calls the API for the user and returns a URL that automatically redirects the users browser to the AWS management console.

AD Connector is designed to give you an easy way to establish a trust relationship between your active directory and AWS.

The “AMI ID does not exist” indicates that the AMI might have been deleted after creating the launch config. As it is not possible to update the launch configs, a new config must be created with a valid AMI.

AWS system manager parameter store provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management


### IAM - Identity and access manager
**Should have been called**  - Users, Keys and Certs
**Use this to** - Set up additional users, set up new AWS Keys and policies.

IAM is a web service that helps you control access to your cloud resources

The first user created is a root user, which should not be used

Allows Granular control for both access and authorization

IAM users are global users and user accounts can be used globally

IAM Best Practices

-   Enable MFA
-   Set Password policies
-   User roles over IAM users. Roles provide a more temporary access
-   implement least privilege
-   Validate IAM Policies Regularly
-   Always use roles for resources

    1.  Prevents tings from happening much like SCP
2.  Detective
    1.  Alerts when action or configurations occur

## Code Deployment Applications

### CloudFormation
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Services Setup
**Use this to**  - Set up a bunch of connected AWS services in one go.


The “Rollback\_Complete” status indicates successful removal of one or more stacks after a failed stack creation

A “Stack Set” lets you create stacks in AWS accounts across regions by using a single cloud formation template

You can use the optional parameters section to customize your templates. Parameters enable you to input custom values to your templates each time you create or update a stack.

Cloudformation change sets allows you to preview how proposed changes to a stack might impact your currently running resources.

Stack- A collection of resources to deploy as a group
Template - A JSON or YAML File that describes the stack
Change Set - Preview/Summary of proposed changes and how they will impact currently running resources
Stackset - Create, Update, delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions. (Stacks that live across multiple accounts using the same template)
Nested Stacks- stacks created as part of other stacks. (Stacks that are contained within a Parent Stack)

Options for Sequencing and Dependencies

-   DependsOn
    -   Used to Specify that the creation of one resource follows another
    -   Controls the order in which your resources are created
    -   Does  not wait for signals of success or failure before moving on
-   Wait Conditions
    -   Pauses execution of a cloudformation template and waits for a success signal before continuing template execution
    -   Waits for success signals before resuming execution of CloudFormation template

Delete Stack fails

-   Some resources must be empty before deleting I.E. S3 buckets
-   Missing permissions to delete
-   Termination protection may be enabled on the stack
    -   For nested stacks, the root stack has protection enabled

Rollback Failed
