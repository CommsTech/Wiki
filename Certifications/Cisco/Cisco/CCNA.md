# CCNA![[CCNA_Notes.pdf]]
- Externally learned EIGRP couter show up as EX 
- EIGRP (redistribute state), OSPF (Default information originate) 
- Three effects of using local span are 
	Â· It doubles the load on the Forwarding engine 
	- It Prevents span destination from using port Security 
	- If doubles internal switch traffic 
- Two device classes ved our serial links are DCE and DTE .
- Autonomous system number and ip are used to identify neighbors in BGP 
- VLAN's can experience slowness due to duplex mismatch. 
- RSTP defines new port roles and is compatible with the original 802.10 STP 
- EIGRP successor routes are used to Formed traffic to adestination and may be backed up by a feasible successor route . 
- Encapsulation is a Feature that Facilitates the tagging of Frames on specific VLANS 
- ESP is used when confidentiality is required on a IPsec Link 
- Discarding and Forwarding are two states of RSTP when the network has converged 
- Same AS number is required for EIGRP to establish adjacency: 
-Three benefits of running TACACS are: 
	device-administration packets are encrypted in their entirety 
	If allows the users to be authenticated against a remote server
	It supports access-level authorization for commands 
- Packet-Loss and Hardware forwarding issues can cause inter-Vlan slowness
- Cloud Computing requires High Speed broadband 
- GRE Sends packets in plain text 
- IGP may use Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford algorithm 
- ACL APIC-EM Path runs on Layer 4 
- Aggregated chassis technology reduces Management overhand and repairs only One IP address per VLAN 
- RADIUS only encrypts the password 
- Stacked switches reduce management complexity and have a single management interface 
- Port Filter ACL's are applied first 
- Link Local addresses must be configured on all IPV 6 interfaces
- Accept, Reject, Error and continue are all responses from a TACACS daemon 
- APIC-EM path trace ACL'S check ingress and egress interfaces 
- Ospf uses Dijkstra, Rip uses Bellman-Ford and EIGRP uses DUAL 
- Link state protocol uses instant updates 
- BGP goes through active, idle and open sent states when establishing peer sessions 
- `show Snmp group` can show current SNMP Security model 
- If proxy ARP is configured on multiple devices, the internal L2 network becomes vulnerable to DDoS 
- QOS provides checksum and inspection. 
- CGMP is not compatible with HSRPv1 
- IaaS and paaS may require network infrastructure redesign 
- CHAP uses MD5 for peer authentication 
- MPLS can provide Authentication header and VPN 
- `debug ppp negotation` and `debug dialer packet` help troubleshoot a failed pppoe link
- QOS can be marked by ip precedence, DSCP and discard Class 
- Remote longing can be enabled With "terminal-monitor" and "logging host ip address" 
- Port priority value can be modified to create a preferred forwarding interface 
- 1 ACL per direction, per layer 3 "protocol" , per interface 
- Router-id must be configured to Enable EIGRPV6 
- Switch access ports drop packets with 802.10 tags
- Double tagging attack was mitigated by changing the native VAN to an unused VLAN 
- HSRP action router is chosen by highest ip add and configured priority 
- RSTP significantly reduces topology recovering time after a link failure
- RTP expands the STP port roles by adding the alternate and backup roles 
- RSTP provides a faster transition to the Forwarding state on point to point links than STP does 
- HSRP ip address acts as a default route for that interface. 
- Load value in `show interface port- chanel 1 etherchannel` is the number of source-destruction pairs
- PVST+ uses 802.1q to tunnel information.
- RSTP Root ports point towards the root bridge connection
- HSRP produces a virtual mac address starting with 00:00(ipv4) or 00:05(ipv6)
- `Show ip interface` can show you interfaces affected by ACL's
- in QOS ports are untrusted by default. 
- When an active HSRP router is preempted by a higher priority router it goes into "Spark" state
- DHCP snooping Can validate address requests and filter out invalid messages
-  APIC- EM can verify ACL's 
- Poison reverse is a learned neighbor with an infinite metric on the route 
- A Switch must be in VTP Server or Transparent mode before configuring a VLAN 
- ICMP packet TTL is default 255 and is decremented by 1 on every hop 
- SNMP view records can be used to restrict OID Groups
- Default port security mode is shutdown 
- QoS can mark ip precedence, DSCP and discard class 
- TACACS+ allows for separate authentication 
- APIC-EM requires source address and Destination address to run 
- APIC-EM automates network actions and makes network Functions programmable 
- Pinging the remote network is the best way to verify a host path 
- Enterprise Managed VPN Saves Money while Securing WAN 
- EIGRP internal routes show up as "D"
