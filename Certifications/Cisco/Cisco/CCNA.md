Flow Control is used to provide a mens for the receiver to 
govern the amount of data sent by the sender 
· OSPF Supports VLSM, Can Confire network instability to one area 
of the network, and it allows extensive control of routing updates 
·"line protocol is up" means the interface is receiving Keepalives 
Ping is also used to verify ipub connectivity 
GDP cubles 
· At minimum fresh routers need to no shut ports to bring up (DP my hut) D-Eigrp, O-OSPF", S.Static, R-RIP, B-BGP, (-Connected) 
· Franc Auto is compatible with Trunk, Access, and desirable ports 
Native VLAN must be configured the same on 802.1, tranking devices 
Laver 2 switches increase the number of collision domains 
and implements VLAN'S 
Late collisions happen when a Cable is too long. CSMA/CD Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection ·Dewes have to wait until lan is silent to transmit. 
· if collision happens the device that caused waits a random amount of time. 
·Workstations require TCP Connection to be established before exchanging Htpctes with server · Broadcast storms Cause Congestion on the lan 
·TCP-Transmission Control protocol UDP - User Datagram Protocol 
· Ping - Echo request to address wat for reply, address reply back deful timeout cisco 2 sec Enabling part security and adding "sticky" ad's dynamically learned mac's to run config · Port security is used to Prevent unauthorized hosts from accessing the lan 
· Physically Securing network equipment should be part of any Comprehensive Security play "NTP Master" Sets the local device as the reference Clock source 
Stratum indicates the distance between a device and it's time source · Default source of NTP Message is the interface of the next hop for server peer · First 24 bits of a MAC address is the CUI Organizational Unique Identifier 
· Data must be encapsulated to traverse the network 
Full-duplex Ethernet networks remove Collisions, require dedicated parts and require network interface Cards (NIC) that can operate in full-duplex ·Sintp 7 application Layer, TCP & Transport Layer, IPinternet leyes, Ethernet Nebork asy · Network layer headers contain the address of destination hosts 
·PAP Stock model Combines physical and data link layers into the network access Layer 
· FTP is connection oriented, TFTP is connection Lass Oriented 
Flow label is new in ipv6 
· 11110 begins a unique local IPV6 address in binary · According to IANA, ISPs assign IPV6 addresses to end users 
These approaches to migrating from ipv4 addressing to ipv6 is Configure ipv4 tunnels between ipub islands 
Use proxying and translation to translate ipv6 packets into ipv4 packets enable dual-stack routing 
IPV6 eminates broadcasts and replaces them with multicasts Default DHCP Binding Lease time is 24 hours 
Ospf Router-id's are Chosen by highest IP of Loopback when no ID is specified Routers running link-State routing protocols use hello packets and 
ISAs From other routes to build and maintain it's topological database 
Directly connected Routes have an administrative distance of @ EIGRP Summary routes have an administrative distance of 5 
· Link-state routing protocols provide common view of 
entire topology, Calculates Shortest Path, and Utilizes event triggered updates Default routes Keep routing tables small and allow connectivity to remote networks RIP 2 has some mas hop as ul, it allows classless routing and supports authentication Administrative distance of connected routes is 8 Passive- interfaces prevent hello messages on an interface Rip is a dynamic routing protocol that uses only hop cant 
LSA - Link State Novertisement 
IP address of the remote router for forwarding packets is indicated by next hop in table IGNDIComple Administrative distance ranks routing protocols according to their preferences. · STP uses path Cost to determine which port to black on non-root bridge (Highest Mc) STP uses Lowest mac to determine foot bridge ·Eigrp Redistribute static, OSPF is Default information originate 
· OFA - is a Route From another area (ospf) 
·OSPF uses link local for sauce and global uncast for destination 
OSPF multicast 224.0.05.6 and FF02: 5 and FF02 :: 6 
OSPF LSAI is inter asen 
OSPF LSA 2 is multi access ·OSPF LSA 3 is intra area 
·OSPF LSA 4 is ASBR 
-OSPF LSA 5 is summary ASBR 
Link state routing builds entre topology (ospf, ISIS) ·Switchport Host adds partfist, makes Access port and disables bod

- Switches by default try to trunk. auto mode with auto will not trunk 
- VTP default mode is server 
- OSPF Election 1) Highest priority 2) highest Router ID 3) highest Loopback, 4) highest active interface
- Stp Port Roles 

	1) Root Port ( RP ) 

	2) Designated (D) 

	3) Alternate (A only RSTP)

	4) Blocking  
	| -- | -- | 

	| Classic Spanning tree | Rapid spanning tree |

	| Blocking | Discarding | 

	| Listening | Discarding |

	| Learning | Learning |

	| Forwarding | Forwarding |

- Spaning-free root bridge is elected by 1) priority, 2)BID, 3) Lowest Mach 
- Link state routing protocols use the link router interface ip address, the network link and the cost of the link as link state information for locally connected Inks 
- Protocol-dependent modules route different Layer 3 protocols 
- Autonomous system numbers function as a process ID in the operation of a router 
- Two valid OSPF v3 destination addresses are FF02::5 (broadcast) and FE80:42 (link-local)
- Eigrp uses lowest configured bandwidth of any interface along the route to Calculate the bandwidth to a destination network 
- Ospf route with a OE1 is an external route advertised by a ASBR 
- Ospf router election process is - 

	1) Router usas explicitly configured router ID 

	2) Router uses highest ip of loopback 

	3) Router uses highest ip of active interfaces 

	4) Router will display console message to configure the router-ID 

- `Show ipv6 protocols` can show all ospf enabled interfaces 
- VTP transfers vlan database across trunks, server mode stores `vlan.dat and vlans can be created modified and deleted on the Server switch 
- by default cisco devices can have 4 equal cost routes to same destination 
- best to manually add `vlan.dat` From server when adding a switch 
- Externally learned EIGRP counter show up as EX 
- EIGRP (redistribute state), OSPF (Default information originate) 
- Three effects of using local span are 
	· It doubles the load on the Forwarding engine 
	- It Prevents span destination from using port Security 
	- If doubles internal switch traffic 
- Two device classes ved our serial links are DCE and DTE .
- Autonomous system number and ip are used to identify neighbors in BGP 
- VLAN's can experience slowness due to duplex mismatch. 
- RSTP defines new port roles and is compatible with the original 802.10 STP 
- EIGRP successor routes are used to Formed traffic to adestination and may be backed up by a feasible successor route . 
- Encapsulation is a Feature that Facilitates the tagging of Frames on specific VLANS 
- ESP is used when confidentiality is required on a IPsec Link 
- Discarding and Forwarding are two states of RSTP when the network has converged 
- Same AS number is required for EIGRP to establish adjacency: 
-Three benefits of running TACACS are: 
	device-administration packets are encrypted in their entirety 
	If allows the users to be authenticated against a remote server
	It supports access-level authorization for commands 
- Packet-Loss and Hardware forwarding issues can cause inter-Vlan slowness
- Cloud Computing requires High Speed broadband 
- GRE Sends packets in plain text 
- IGP may use Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford algorithm 
- ACL APIC-EM Path runs on Layer 4 
- Aggregated chassis technology reduces Management overhand and repairs only One IP address per VLAN 
- RADIUS only encrypts the password 
- Stacked switches reduce management complexity and have a single management interface 
- Port Filter ACL's are applied first 
- Link Local addresses must be configured on all IPV 6 interfaces
- Accept, Reject, Error and continue are all responses from a TACACS daemon 
- APIC-EM path trace ACL'S check ingress and egress interfaces 
- Ospf uses Dijkstra, Rip uses Bellman-Ford and EIGRP uses DUAL 
- Link state protocol uses instant updates 
- BGP goes through active, idle and open sent states when establishing peer sessions

- Remote longing can be enabled With "terminal-monitor" and "logging host ip address" 
- Port priority value can be modified to create a preferred forwarding interface 
- 1 ACL per direction, per layer 3 "protocol" , per interface 
- Router-id must be configured to Enable EIGRPV6 
- Switch access ports drop packets with 802.10 tags
- Double tagging attack was mitigated by changing the native VAN to an unused VLAN 
- HSRP action router is chosen by highest ip add and configured priority 
- RSTP significantly reduces topology recovering time after a link failure
- RTP expands the STP port roles by adding the alternate and backup roles 
- RSTP provides a faster transition to the Forwarding state on point to point links than STP does 
- HSRP ip address acts as a default route for that interface. 
- Load value in `show interface port- chanel 1 etherchannel` is the number of source-destruction pairs
- PVST+ uses 802.1q to tunnel information.
- RSTP Root ports point towards the root bridge connection
- HSRP produces a virtual mac address starting with 00:00(ipv4) or 00:05(ipv6)
- `Show ip interface` can show you interfaces affected by ACL's
- in QOS ports are untrusted by default. 
- When an active HSRP router is preempted by a higher priority router it goes into "Spark" state
- DHCP snooping Can validate address requests and filter out invalid messages
-  APIC- EM can verify ACL's 
- Poison reverse is a learned neighbor with an infinite metric on the route
