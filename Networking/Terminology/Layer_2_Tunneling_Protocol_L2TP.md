# Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

**Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)**Â is a protocol used for encapsulating and transporting Layer 2 frames over IP networks. It was developed as a combination of Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and Cisco's Layer 2 Forwarding Protocol (L2F). L2TP allows the extension of Layer 2 services, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), across wide area networks (WANs) or the Internet.

L2TP operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and encapsulates Layer 2 frames within Layer 3 packets for transmission over IP networks. It offers additional methods for authentication compared to PPTP, providing five different authentication methods: Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), Microsoft CHAP version 1 and 2, and EAP-TLS.

L2TP is widely used in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and other applications where Layer 2 connectivity needs to be maintained across wide area networks or the Internet. It provides a cost-effective solution for extending Layer 2 services over IP networks while maintaining security, reliability, and performance.
