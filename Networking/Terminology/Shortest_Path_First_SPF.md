# Shortest Path First (SPF)

**Shortest Path First (SPF)**Â is a routing algorithm used in link-state and distance-vector routing protocols to determine the shortest path between two nodes in a network based on various metrics, such as hop count, bandwidth, delay, or cost. The primary goal of SPF algorithms is to find the most efficient and reliable route for data transfer while minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.

The most common implementation of SPF is Dijkstra's Algorithm, which is used by Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol. The algorithm starts at a single node in the network and calculates the shortest path to all other nodes based on the available link metrics. It does this by maintaining a priority queue of nodes that need to be processed and iteratively updating the shortest path to each node as new information is received.

Once the SPF algorithm has completed, the resulting shortest paths are installed in the routing table, and data traffic is forwarded accordingly. This process ensures that the network converges quickly and efficiently after topology changes, minimizing the impact on network performance and connectivity.
