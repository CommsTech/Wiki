## Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)

**Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)**Â is a system used to manage, distribute, and validate digital certificates for IP address space and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs). RPKI extends the traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) concept to the Internet routing domain. It provides a secure way to verify the authenticity of routing information by digitally signing routing data with cryptographic keys.

RPKI uses X.509 certificates to authenticate and authorize the allocation, assignment, and maintenance of IP address space and ASNs. This helps prevent various routing security issues like route hijacking, prefix hijacking, and other forms of routing attacks. RPKI also enables secure inter-domain routing by providing a trust model that allows routers to validate routing information based on the digital signatures in the certificates.

RPKI is an essential component of modern Internet security and plays a crucial role in securing the global routing system, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of routing information, and improving overall network security.
