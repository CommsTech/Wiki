# Lightweight Extensible Markup Language (XLM)

**Lightweight Extensible Markup Language (XLM)** is a markup language used for encoding and transmitting configuration data between network devices, such as routers and switches. XLM is designed to be lightweight and efficient compared to other markup languages like XML or HTML. It was developed by Cisco Systems for use with their networking equipment and is also known as **Cisco Configuration Protocol (CCP)** when used in Cisco devices.

XLM uses a tree-like structure, similar to XML, to represent configuration data. However, it has a more streamlined syntax that makes it easier to parse and process. XLM supports both configuration and error reporting, allowing network administrators to efficiently manage and troubleshoot their networks. It is widely used in Cisco's proprietary protocols like SNMPv3 and NetFlow for exchanging information between devices.

XLM plays a crucial role in managing large-scale service provider networks by enabling efficient configuration management, automation, and interoperability among various network elements.
