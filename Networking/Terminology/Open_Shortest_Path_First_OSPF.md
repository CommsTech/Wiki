# Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

**Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**Â is a link-state routing protocol that uses the Dijkstra's Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to determine the shortest path between two nodes in an Internet Protocol (IP) network. OSPF was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and is widely used for routing within an autonomous system or a single area in large IP networks.

OSPF uses a link-state database to maintain information about the entire network topology, allowing all routers to have identical copies of the network's state. Each router shares its link-state information with its neighbors, which is then propagated throughout the network. OSPF supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can be used for both interior gateway routing (IGP) and inter-autonomous system routing (EGP).

OSPF offers several advantages like scalability, loop-free topology, and fast convergence. It also supports various features such as Virtual Links, Stub areas, and Area Border Routers to optimize network design and improve network performance.

OSPF uses metrics like hop count, bandwidth, and cost to determine the shortest path between routers. The chosen path is then installed in the routing table, and data traffic is forwarded accordingly.
