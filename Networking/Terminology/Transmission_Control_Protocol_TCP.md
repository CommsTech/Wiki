# TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

**TCP** is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, error-checked, and ordered delivery of data between two endpoints. It establishes a connection before transmitting data and maintains it throughout the entire session.

## Features
1. **Reliable**: TCP ensures all packets are delivered in order and without errors.
2. **Connection-oriented**: Establishes a dedicated connection between sender and receiver.
3. **Flow control**: Adjusts transmission rate based on network conditions.
4. **Error checking**: Provides error detection and correction mechanisms.
5. **Ordered delivery**: Guarantees that data is delivered in the order it was sent.

## Use cases
1. File transfers (FTP, SFTP)
2. Email
3. Web browsing (HTTP)
4. Remote login (SSH)
