# Quality of Service (QoS)

**Quality of Service (QoS)**Â refers to the ability of a network to provide better handling and prioritization for specific types of traffic based on their importance or requirements. QoS is essential in networks where multiple applications and services compete for limited resources, such as bandwidth and processing power. The primary goal of QoS is to ensure that critical applications receive the required level of performance while minimizing contention and congestion within the network.

QoS techniques include:

1. **Traffic Shaping**: Regulating the rate at which traffic is sent into a network to prevent congestion and ensure fairness among different types of traffic.
2. **Traffic Policing**: Limiting the amount of traffic that can be transmitted during a specific time interval based on predefined policies.
3. **Priority Queuing**: Prioritizing certain types of traffic over others based on their importance or requirements.
4. **Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)**: A signaling protocol used to reserve network resources for specific applications and services, ensuring they receive the required level of bandwidth and QoS.
5. **Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ)**: A queuing algorithm that assigns different weights to different types of traffic based on their priority, ensuring high-priority traffic is served before low-priority traffic when network resources are limited.

By implementing QoS, service providers and enterprises can ensure that critical applications receive the required level of performance while minimizing contention and congestion within the network.
