# Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A **Virtual Private Network** (VPN) is a secure and encrypted network connection that extends a private network over a public infrastructure, such as the Internet. VPNs enable users to access resources on a remote or geographically dispersed network as if they were directly connected to it. This technology provides several benefits, including increased security, cost savings, and flexibility.

There are two main types of VPNs: Remote Access VPNs (RAS) and Site-to-Site VPNs. In a Remote Access VPN, individual users connect to the corporate network from remote locations using client software or dedicated hardware devices. Site-to-Site VPNs, on the other hand, connect entire networks, allowing them to communicate with each other securely over the Internet.

VPNs use various encryption technologies like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) to protect data transmitted between the client and server or between sites. VPNs are widely used by organizations to provide secure access to their networks for remote workers, partners, and suppliers while maintaining security and control over their network resources.

In the context of Cisco Service Provider Next-Generation Core Network Services (SPCORE), VPNs can be implemented using technologies like Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) VPNs.
