## Open Shortest Path First Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (OSPF-IGP)

**Open Shortest Path First Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (OSPF-IGP)**Â is a link-state, hierarchical routing protocol designed for use in large and complex Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It is an interior gateway protocol, meaning it operates within an autonomous system or domain. OSPF-IGP uses the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to determine the shortest path between routers based on metrics such as hop count, bandwidth, and cost.

OSPF-IGP is a popular choice for routing in large IP networks due to its ability to adapt to network changes quickly and efficiently. It supports various features like Area Border Gateway Protocol (ABGW) for scalability, Virtual Links for non-physical connections, and Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) for efficient address space utilization.

OSPF-IGP is widely used in enterprise networks and service provider networks to build large IP networks with high availability, redundancy, and scalability. It offers features like link-state advertisements, hello packets, and dead gateway detection to maintain a consistent view of the network topology among all routers within the autonomous system.

OSPF-IGP is an open standard defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and is interoperable with other routing protocols like Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for internet connectivity.
