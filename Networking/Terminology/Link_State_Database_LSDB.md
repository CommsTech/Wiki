# Link State Database (LSDB)

A **Link State Database (LSDB)** is a data structure used in link state routing protocols like Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS), and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The LSDB stores the complete topology information of a network, including all routers, links, and their respective states.

Each router in a link state network maintains an identical copy of the LSDB. When a change occurs in the network, such as a link going down or coming up, each router updates its LSDB and sends the updated information to its neighbors. The neighbors then update their LSDBs with this new information, ensuring that all routers have consistent information about the network topology.

The Dijkstra Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path between networks based on the information in the LSDB. This process results in optimal routing and efficient traffic flow within the network. The LSDB plays a crucial role in maintaining the convergence of the network during changes, ensuring that all routers have up-to-date information about the network topology.
