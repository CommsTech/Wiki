# Bandwidth Broker

A **Bandwidth Broker** is a network device or software component that manages and allocates available bandwidth among multiple applications, services, or users in a network. It acts as an intermediary between the network elements and the applications or services requesting bandwidth. The primary goal of a Bandwidth Broker is to ensure fair distribution of available bandwidth while maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for different applications and services.

Bandwidth brokers are commonly used in service provider networks, where multiple applications and services compete for limited network resources. By managing the allocation of bandwidth, a Bandwidth Broker helps ensure that each application or service receives its fair share while minimizing contention and congestion within the network.
