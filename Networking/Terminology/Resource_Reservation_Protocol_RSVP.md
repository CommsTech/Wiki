# Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)

**Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)**Â is a signaling protocol used in IP networks to provide end-to-end reservation of resources for real-time and other sensitive applications. It enables the setup of multicast or unicast sessions between multiple communicating nodes, allowing them to reserve bandwidth, buffer space, and other network resources along the path between them.

RSVP operates by having each sender send a Path message to request resource reservations from all routers along the data flow path. The receivers then send Reservation messages back to the sender, confirming or denying the requested resources. Once the reservation is established, RSVP sets up and maintains the forwarding state in the network devices, ensuring that the required resources are available for the duration of the session.

RSVP is commonly used in multicast applications, such as video conferencing, audio streaming, and telepresence, where real-time traffic requires guaranteed bandwidth and low latency. It provides a scalable and efficient way to manage resources in IP networks while minimizing signaling overhead and maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for different applications.

RSVP is an important component of IntServ (Integrated Services in the Internet Architecture), which aims to provide guaranteed QoS in IP networks. It is defined by RFC 2205, RFC 3178, and other related specifications.
