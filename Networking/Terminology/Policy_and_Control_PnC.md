## Policy and Control (PnC)

**Policy and Control (PnC)**Â refers to the process of managing network traffic based on predefined policies that determine how data should be handled as it traverses a network. PnC systems enable network administrators to enforce security, quality of service (QoS), and other requirements for specific applications, services, or users.

PnC solutions typically include components like firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, traffic shapers, and access control lists. These components inspect and make decisions based on various criteria such as source/destination IP addresses, application type, port numbers, and protocols to ensure that network policies are enforced consistently across the entire network.

PnC plays a crucial role in maintaining security, improving network performance, and ensuring compliance with organizational policies and industry regulations. It is an essential component of modern service provider networks, enabling them to offer value-added services and maintain high levels of security and QoS for their customers.

Some common PnC protocols include Open Shortest Path First Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (OSPF-IGP), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
