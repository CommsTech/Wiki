# Traffic Engineering (TE)

**Traffic Engineering (TE)**Â is a network design and optimization technique used to improve network performance, reliability, and capacity by controlling the distribution of traffic flow in a network. The primary goal of Traffic Engineering is to minimize congestion, reduce latency, and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for different applications and services.

Traffic Engineering techniques include:

1. **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic evenly across multiple links or paths to prevent overloading a single link or path.
2. **Path Protection**: Providing backup paths for traffic in case of link or node failures, ensuring network resilience and high availability.
3. **Link Utilization**: Optimizing link utilization by distributing traffic efficiently among available resources.
4. **Bandwidth Allocation**: Ensuring that each application or service receives the required bandwidth while minimizing contention and congestion within the network.

Traffic Engineering is commonly used in Service Provider networks, where multiple applications and services compete for limited network resources. By optimizing traffic flow, Traffic Engineering helps improve overall network performance, reliability, and QoS.

Some popular Traffic Engineering techniques include Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering and Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing.
