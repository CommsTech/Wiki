# Access Point Name (APN)

An **Access Point Name** (APN) is a label used to identify a specific point of access to the Internet or a public data network, such as a 3G, 4G, or 5G mobile network. APNs are typically configured in Mobile Network Operators' networks and are used by mobile devices to establish a connection with the internet via a packet gateway or a proxy server.
