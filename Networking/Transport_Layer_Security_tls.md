title: Transport Layer Security (TLS)
description: TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communications on the internet. It's used to encrypt data between two parties, ensuring that sensitive information transmitted remains confidential and integrity is maintained. TLS builds upon its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), providing improved security through stronger encryption algorithms and additional features.

# TLS

**Transport Layer Security** (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communications on the internet. It's used to encrypt data between two parties, ensuring that sensitive information transmitted remains confidential and integrity is maintained. TLS builds upon its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), providing improved security through stronger encryption algorithms and additional features.
