## Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

**Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**Â is a distance-vector routing protocol that was first introduced in 1988 for IP networks. It uses hop count as its primary metric to determine the shortest path between two routers. RIP is a classful routing protocol, meaning it does not support Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSMs) or subnetting directly.

RIP operates on an assumedly fully-connected network model and relies on periodic broadcasts of complete routing tables to neighboring routers. Each router maintains a table of all known routes, which is then shared with its neighbors at regular intervals. RIP has a maximum hop count limit of 15 hops, making it less suitable for large networks.

RIPv2, an enhanced version of the original RIP protocol, was introduced in 1993 to address some limitations of RIP, such as support for VLSMs and subnetting. Despite its limitations, RIP remains widely used due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. However, it is generally replaced by more advanced routing protocols like Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) in larger networks that require more robust and scalable routing solutions.

RIP's primary advantage is its simplicity and ease of configuration, making it a popular choice for small to medium-sized networks where complexity and cost are significant factors.
