## Label Switched Path (LSP)

A **Label Switched Path (LSP)** is a dedicated path in a network that carries traffic between two endpoints using a label-switched routing technique. In MPLS networks, LSPs are established and maintained by signaling protocols like Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP), or Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MBGP).

Each LSP is assigned a unique label that is used to forward packets along the path. The labels simplify routing decisions, allowing for faster packet forwarding and efficient traffic engineering. LSPs can be unidirectional or bidirectional and are used in various applications like Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Traffic Engineering, and MPLS VPNs.

LSPs offer several advantages over traditional IP routing, such as faster convergence times, improved security, and better traffic engineering capabilities. They enable service providers to offer differentiated services with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) levels and efficient bandwidth utilization.

In summary, LSPs are essential components in MPLS networks that provide dedicated paths for traffic flow, enabling faster and more efficient routing while ensuring QoS and security.
