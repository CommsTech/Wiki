## High-Level Signaling Protocol (HLSP)

**High-Level Signaling Protocol (HLSP)**Â is a signaling protocol used in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks to establish and maintain label-switched paths (LSPs). HLSP is responsible for exchanging signaling messages between Label Switching Routers (LSRs) to set up, modify, or tear down LSPs.

HLSP operates at the control plane of an MPLS network and uses various extensions to support different types of LSPs, such as Label Switched Paths (LSPs), Label Switched Virtual Circuits (LSVCs), and Label Switched Tree (LST) services. HLSP messages are exchanged between Label Switching Routers using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP).

HLSP plays a crucial role in establishing end-to-end connectivity across an MPLS network by enabling efficient and reliable communication between LSRs, ensuring that label bindings are correctly established and maintained.

Some of the key features of HLSP include support for multi-protocol environments, traffic engineering, and scalability. It also provides mechanisms to handle various signaling scenarios like graceful restoration and link protection.
