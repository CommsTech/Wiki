## Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)

**Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)**Â is a widely used digital cellular communication standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). GSM was first deployed in Europe in 1992 and has since become the most popular mobile communication system worldwide. It supports both circuit-switched and packet-switched services, including voice calls, SMS, MMS, and data services like GPRS, EDGE, and 3G.

GSM uses Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) for uplink and downlink communication between the mobile station (mobile phone) and the Base Transceiver Station Subsystem (BTS). It also supports several frequency bands, including 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz. GSM networks use a hierarchical architecture consisting of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS), Base Station Controllers (BSC), Mobile Switching Centers (MSC), and Home Location Registers (HLR) to manage call routing and mobility management.

GSM's widespread adoption is due to its robustness, reliability, and scalability, making it a cornerstone of mobile communication networks for over three decades.
