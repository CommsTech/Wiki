# Carrier Ethernet

**Carrier Ethernet**Â is a telecommunications technology that provides WAN connectivity using Ethernet protocols over traditional circuit-switched networks, such as SONET or SDH. It offers several advantages over traditional WAN technologies like T1/T3 and Frame Relay by providing higher bandwidth, lower latency, and improved scalability. Carrier Ethernet is designed to meet the requirements of enterprise and service provider networks for high-speed connectivity, reliability, and Quality of Service (QoS).

Carrier Ethernet uses standard Ethernet technologies like VLANs, QoS, and link aggregation to create a scalable, resilient, and efficient network infrastructure. It supports various services such as Ethernet Virtual Private LAN Services (EVPLS), Ethernet Virtual Private Networks (EVPN), and Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services.

Carrier Ethernet is widely adopted due to its flexibility, ease of deployment, and ability to support multiple services over a single infrastructure, making it an essential technology for modern service provider networks.
