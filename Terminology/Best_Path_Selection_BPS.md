# Best Path Selection (BPS)
**Best Path Selection (BPS)**Â is a process used in routing protocols to determine the best path for data transmission between two endpoints based on various metrics, such as hop count, bandwidth, delay, and reliability. The goal of BPS is to find the most efficient and reliable route for data transfer while minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.

Different routing protocols use different algorithms for best path selection, such as Dijkstra's Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm used by Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or the Bellman-Ford algorithm used by Link State Routing Protocols like OSPF and Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS). The chosen path is then installed in the routing table, and data traffic is forwarded accordingly.
