 XCP NG
## What is XCP-NG?

First of all, what is XCP-NG? XCP-NG is a virtualization platform based on the Xen Project hosted in the Linux Foundation. Being based on XenServer, it is a collaboration between individuals and businesses looking to deliver an open-source virtualization project that can meet the challenges of the enterprise today.

Its features include the following:

- **Modern UI** – It offers a modern UI for management called Xen Orchestra. There is also a Windows-based management tool called XCP-NG center that allows managing your XCP-NG hosts, etc.
- **Live migration** – This is probably what drew most of us to virtualization and got us hooked to begin with – [live migration](https://www.virtualizationhowto.com/2020/12/vmware-vcenter-server-7-update-1-advanced-cross-vcenter-vmotion/). XCP-NG offers the ability to move running virtual machines between hosts.
- **Scalability** – You can grow and scale your infrastructure as needed. Simply add a host to your XCP-NG environment
- **Security** – With XCP-NG, you can run your own private data center without the concerns of shared public cloud infrastructure.
