I found the following code snippit:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-fallback\" data-lang=\"fallback\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">{{ if not (eq (len $.Site.Taxonomies.tags) 0) }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $fontUnit := &#34;rem&#34; }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $largestFontSize := 2.0 }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $largestFontSize := 2.5 }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $smallestFontSize := 1.0 }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $fontSpread := sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $max := add (len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount 0).Pages) 1 }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $min := len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount.Reverse 0).Pages }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $spread := sub $max $min }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $fontStep := div $fontSpread $spread }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;div class=&#34;widget-taglist widget&#34;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">  &lt;h4 class=&#34;widget__title&#34;&gt;{{ T &#34;tags_title&#34; }}&lt;/h4&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">   &lt;div class=&#34;widget__content&#34;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    &lt;div id=&#34;tag-cloud&#34; style=&#34;padding: 5px 15px&#34;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">        {{ range $name, $taxonomy := $.Site.Taxonomies.tags }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $currentTagCount := len $taxonomy.Pages }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $currentTagCount $min) $fontStep) ) }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $count := len $taxonomy.Pages }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $weigth := div (sub (math.Log $count) (math.Log $min)) (sub (math.Log $max) (math.Log $min)) }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize) $weigth) ) }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            &lt;!--Current font size: {{$currentFontSize}}--&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            &lt;a href=&#34;{{ &#34;/tags/&#34; | relLangURL }}{{ $name | urlize }}&#34; style=&#34;font-size:{{$currentFontSize}}{{$fontUnit}}&#34;&gt;{{ $name }}&lt;/a&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">        {{ end }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    &lt;/div&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">  &lt;/div&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;/div&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">{{ end }}\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After replacing <code>siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/widgets/taglist.html</code> with the following code.

However, once I figured out the SVG format can be edited in a simple text editor and I mirrored the size and types from the existing SVG files they showed up.</p>\n<p>Here are the Edits I made to <em>social.html</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-fallback\" data-lang=\"fallback\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">{{- with .Site.Params.widgets.social.twitch }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\t\t&lt;div class=&#34;widget-social__item widget__item&#34;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\t\t\t&lt;a class=&#34;widget-social__link widget__link btn&#34; title=&#34;Twitch&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; href=&#34;https://twitch.tv/{{ . }}&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\t\t\t\t{{ partial &#34;svg/twitch.svg&#34; (dict &#34;class&#34; &#34;widget-social__link-icon&#34;) }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\t\t\t\t&lt;span&gt;Twitch Live Streams&lt;/span&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\t\t\t&lt;/a&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\t\t&lt;/div&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\t\t{{- end }}\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Basically after getting the SVG setup and putting the twitch.svg and youtube.svg in this path <code>siteroot/mainroad/layouts/partials/svg</code> I was able to get the Social widget exactly how I wanted.</p>\n<h5 id=\"tags-widget\">Tags Widget</h5>\n<p>Next up was fixing the tags on the sidebar. They were blocky and quite ugly, where I wanted a traditional tag cloud that you see on many other sites to help users navigate your content. So I began looking at other projects that had the proper code. I found the following code snippit:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-fallback\" data-lang=\"fallback\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">{{ if not (eq (len $.Site.Taxonomies.tags) 0) }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $fontUnit := &#34;rem&#34; }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $largestFontSize := 2.0 }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $largestFontSize := 2.5 }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $smallestFontSize := 1.0 }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $fontSpread := sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $max := add (len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount 0).Pages) 1 }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $min := len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount.Reverse 0).Pages }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $spread := sub $max $min }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    {{ $fontStep := div $fontSpread $spread }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;div class=&#34;widget-taglist widget&#34;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">  &lt;h4 class=&#34;widget__title&#34;&gt;{{ T &#34;tags_title&#34; }}&lt;/h4&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">   &lt;div class=&#34;widget__content&#34;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    &lt;div id=&#34;tag-cloud&#34; style=&#34;padding: 5px 15px&#34;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">        {{ range $name, $taxonomy := $.Site.Taxonomies.tags }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $currentTagCount := len $taxonomy.Pages }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $currentTagCount $min) $fontStep) ) }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $count := len $taxonomy.Pages }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $weigth := div (sub (math.Log $count) (math.Log $min)) (sub (math.Log $max) (math.Log $min)) }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            {{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize) $weigth) ) }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            &lt;!--Current font size: {{$currentFontSize}}--&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">            &lt;a href=&#34;{{ &#34;/tags/&#34; | relLangURL }}{{ $name | urlize }}&#34; style=&#34;font-size:{{$currentFontSize}}{{$fontUnit}}&#34;&gt;{{ $name }}&lt;/a&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">        {{ end }}\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    &lt;/div&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">  &lt;/div&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;/div&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">{{ end }}\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After replacing <code>siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/widgets/taglist.html</code> with the following code.

The files are located in <code>siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/header.html or footer.html</code>. You can leave the stock, but I wanted to add a privacy policy and terms of service to be compliant.</p>\n<h4 id=\"table-of-contents-changes\">Table of Contents Changes</h4>\n<p>I replaced the title &ldquo;PAGE CONTENTS&rdquo; with share buttons using a share-buttons.html I created. This could all be done in the post-toc.html file, but I wanted to keep it modular and not make too many edits to the theme. Here were my changes:</p>\n<p><em>siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/post-toc.html</em></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-fallback\" data-lang=\"fallback\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">{{ if .Param &#34;toc&#34;

Netlify, my host, didn&rsquo;t charge anything until I was breaking 100GB of bandwidth and 100,000 active users PER MONTH! Now with double those numbers I pay only $19 a month and have 1 TB (Terabyte) of data per month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-workflow-and-overview\">The Workflow and Overview</h2>\n<p>Typically before I start recording any video, I write an outline and publish it on my website. It&rsquo;s almost like a video script, but also a copy paste guide for either a viewer or just someone searching google.</p>\n<p>This is done by using a static site generator. There are bunch on the market, but the one that suited my needs the best is <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a>. It has a bunch of themes ready to use out of the box @ <a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/\">https://themes.gohugo.io/</a> and is extremely modular.</p>\n<p>Then there are the annoyances of other website platforms like WordPress. You need to go on the web and use some terrible web based editor that just is slow and takes a long time. Hugo fixes this by using both GitHub and Netlify for deployment.

Tab out files, read other contents into an existing file, and have a file explorer with full undo logs. I could go on, but you get the idea.</li>\n<li><strong>Coding</strong> is where most people’s mind goes with Neovim. You have the rockstars, like primeagen, that make Neovim look like a tool of the gods and mere mortals use other editors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<p>With Neovim being so young in releases the latest release you can get is the best. Anything below 0.7 is too low as it won’t have the features you will need for the best experience. I highly recommend downloading directly from Neovim’s GitHub releases: <a href=\"https://github.com/Neovim/Neovim/releases/tag/stable\">https://github.com/Neovim/Neovim/releases/tag/stable</a></p>\n<p>All dependencies and requirements are in my setup.sh for Linux and winsetup.ps1 for Windows from: <a href=\"https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Neovim\">https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Neovim</a></p>\n<div data-sanitized-class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-sanitized-class=\"chroma\"><code data-lang=\"fallback\" data-sanitized-class=\"language-fallback\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">git clone https://github.com/christitustech/Neovim\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">cd Neovim\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">sudo ./setup.sh\n</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 data-sanitized-id=\"windows-powershell-alternative\">Windows PowerShell Alternative</h3>\n<p>I modified PowerShell to also use Neovim. I did make a <code>winsetup.ps1</code> to help aid in the setup, but there will be more manual steps to this setup.</p>\n<p>Included cpp compiler and runtime to assist in programming, but the biggest thing to setup is nodejs. This has an automated script that will fix python and other dependencies that are problematic in Windows.</p>\n<p>Setting PATH in Windows is your biggest priority for a functional Neovim. Type <code>sysdm.cpl</code> to launch into System Properties and click Advanced -&gt; Environment Variables to set the paths. Add any missing health checks here.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"configuration\">Configuration</h2>\n<p>Instead of making a big modular structure that you see in most Neovim projects, mine is small for ease of learning. It will expand as times goes on, but I want to KISS it… Keep it stupid simple. There is 3 files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>init.lua</code> - Initializes Neovim and calls any extra files. These are my main settings and special plugin configurations. _Note: some people use the old <code>init.vim</code> instead of lua, but that defeats the purpose of using Neovim.</li>\n<li><code>lua/keymaps.lua</code> - These are all my key bindings for Neovim</li>\n<li><code>lua/plugins.lua</code> - List of plugins to load.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"startup\">Startup</h2>\n<p>USE <code>:checkhealth</code> FIRST!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/neovim-is-better/checkhealth.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Errors must be fixed to have a functional Neovim experience. Warnings can be ignored, but noted, because you may have failed installs for LSPs, Linters, and other tools.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"adding-tools\">Adding Tools</h3>\n<p><code>:Mason</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/neovim-is-better/mason.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Note: I recommend ONLY installing what you USE!</em></p>\n<p>Shortcuts for Mason:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>i = install</li>\n<li>U = upgrade package</li>\n<li>X = remove package</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"what-not-to-do\">What NOT to do</h2>\n<p>Neovim is such a powerful editor that it can do anything. Before you do this, ask yourself, “Do I use this?” and if not, do NOT install it!</p>\n<p>If you want all the plugins and have every language supported, I’d recommend Lunar vim or NvChad. These projects do a fantastic job of emulating every part of vscode, while also having an easy install and setup.</p>\n<p>I’d recommend installing them to see what Neovim is capable of, but I did NOT like them for the long term. This is because Neovim needs a personal touch to see its true power.</p>\n<p>I fell in love with Neovim once I started to add the features I used. Remember, you can always expand later.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"walkthrough-video\">Walkthrough Video</h2>\n\n<div>\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VbOLOuiHUI\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"></iframe>\n</div>","content":"<p>I’ve never experienced a program with such power and potential than Neovim.

I could go on, but you get the idea.</li>\n<li><strong>Coding</strong> is where most people’s mind goes with Neovim. You have the rockstars, like primeagen, that make Neovim look like a tool of the gods and mere mortals use other editors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<p>With Neovim being so young in releases the latest release you can get is the best. Anything below 0.7 is too low as it won’t have the features you will need for the best experience. I highly recommend downloading directly from Neovim’s GitHub releases: <a href=\"https://github.com/Neovim/Neovim/releases/tag/stable\">https://github.com/Neovim/Neovim/releases/tag/stable</a></p>\n<p>All dependencies and requirements are in my setup.sh for Linux and winsetup.ps1 for Windows from: <a href=\"https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Neovim\">https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Neovim</a></p>\n<div data-sanitized-class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-sanitized-class=\"chroma\"><code data-lang=\"fallback\" data-sanitized-class=\"language-fallback\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">git clone https://github.com/christitustech/Neovim\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">cd Neovim\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">sudo ./setup.sh\n</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 data-sanitized-id=\"windows-powershell-alternative\">Windows PowerShell Alternative</h3>\n<p>I modified PowerShell to also use Neovim. I did make a <code>winsetup.ps1</code> to help aid in the setup, but there will be more manual steps to this setup.</p>\n<p>Included cpp compiler and runtime to assist in programming, but the biggest thing to setup is nodejs. This has an automated script that will fix python and other dependencies that are problematic in Windows.</p>\n<p>Setting PATH in Windows is your biggest priority for a functional Neovim. Type <code>sysdm.cpl</code> to launch into System Properties and click Advanced -&gt; Environment Variables to set the paths. Add any missing health checks here.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"configuration\">Configuration</h2>\n<p>Instead of making a big modular structure that you see in most Neovim projects, mine is small for ease of learning. It will expand as times goes on, but I want to KISS it… Keep it stupid simple. There is 3 files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>init.lua</code> - Initializes Neovim and calls any extra files. These are my main settings and special plugin configurations. _Note: some people use the old <code>init.vim</code> instead of lua, but that defeats the purpose of using Neovim.</li>\n<li><code>lua/keymaps.lua</code> - These are all my key bindings for Neovim</li>\n<li><code>lua/plugins.lua</code> - List of plugins to load.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"startup\">Startup</h2>\n<p>USE <code>:checkhealth</code> FIRST!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/neovim-is-better/checkhealth.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Errors must be fixed to have a functional Neovim experience. Warnings can be ignored, but noted, because you may have failed installs for LSPs, Linters, and other tools.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"adding-tools\">Adding Tools</h3>\n<p><code>:Mason</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/neovim-is-better/mason.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Note: I recommend ONLY installing what you USE!</em></p>\n<p>Shortcuts for Mason:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>i = install</li>\n<li>U = upgrade package</li>\n<li>X = remove package</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"what-not-to-do\">What NOT to do</h2>\n<p>Neovim is such a powerful editor that it can do anything. Before you do this, ask yourself, “Do I use this?” and if not, do NOT install it!</p>\n<p>If you want all the plugins and have every language supported, I’d recommend Lunar vim or NvChad. These projects do a fantastic job of emulating every part of vscode, while also having an easy install and setup.</p>\n<p>I’d recommend installing them to see what Neovim is capable of, but I did NOT like them for the long term. This is because Neovim needs a personal touch to see its true power.</p>\n<p>I fell in love with Neovim once I started to add the features I used. Remember, you can always expand later.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"walkthrough-video\">Walkthrough Video</h2>\n\n<div>\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VbOLOuiHUI\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"></iframe>\n</div>","category":"","link":"https://christitus.com/neovim-is-better/","creator":"","pubDate":"Sun, 06 Nov 2022 19:00:00 -0500","enclosure":"","enclosureType":"","image":"","id":"","language":"","folder":"Linux","feed":"Linux","read":false,"favorite":false,"created":false,"tags":[],"hash":"74eb50a8894cd8941b13170476da72f0","highlights":[]},{"title":"Why I Hate Most Linux Distributions","description":"<p>I love Linux, but the distributions for desktop systems isn’t fun to navigate.

Most times just re-flashing with a factory bios fixes most the issues I’ve encountered.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"walkthrough-video\">Walkthrough Video</h2>\n\n<div>\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X44gW2BoSpc\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"></iframe>\n</div>","category":"","link":"https://christitus.com/buying-cheap-ebay-graphics-card/","creator":"","pubDate":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:00:00 -0400","enclosure":"","enclosureType":"","image":"","id":"","language":"","folder":"Linux","feed":"Linux","read":false,"favorite":false,"created":false,"tags":[],"hash":"537128c689b6750f85bbffde67d03836","highlights":[]},{"title":"Why the Command Line is Overpowered","description":"<p>When I say “Overpowered”, this means the command line interfaces can do things that are otherwise impossible.</p>\n<blockquote data-sanitized-class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Do you think the command line in all operating systems (Windows, MacOS, and Linux) is Overpowered?</p>— Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christitustech/status/1578822405518397442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 8, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"all-operating-systems\">All Operating Systems</h2>\n<p>When your think of command line interfaces or CLI, there are a lot of things that come to my mind, but let’s go over how they are overpowered in EVERY operating system.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"windows\">Windows</h3>\n<p>Both PowerShell and Command Prompt in Windows can do some amazing things.

Let’s configure it from a noobs perspective and show you it’s power.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"why-vim\">Why VIM?</h2>\n<p>There is so many things to learn about VIM, but before we start the question often pops up why not just use VS Code or IntelliJ?</p>\n<p>VS Code and IntelliJ have some fantastic ease of use, and great debugging capabilities. There is extension support to add some amazing functionality. So why do many programmers still use VIM? one word: SPEED!</p>\n<p>There is nothing that can even compare when it comes to speed from a veteran VIM user. They will blaze through code at the speed of light and change so much on their screen that you will have a hard time following just watching it. Don’t believe me? Just watch ANY “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen/videos\">The Primeagen</a>” videos</p>\n<p>So if it’s so fast why don’t most people use VIM? It’s hard and has one of the biggest learning curves that I have ever seen from any program. It will take <strong>YEARS</strong> to master, months to be better than vs code/intellij editors, and weeks of learning to be comparable to any other editor on the market.</p>\n<p>However, the payoff is beyond worth it to me. The reward feels so good when you start to <em>get</em> it. The big thing… you can throw your mouse away, because when you get it… a mouse is no longer needed.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"beginning-steps\">Beginning steps</h2>\n<p>The very first thing you need to know about vim is the modes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Normal Mode - The default mode you enter into on launch. This allows quick movement, exiting, commands, but you don’t “type” in this mode.</li>\n<li>Insert Mode - Pressing <code>i</code> on your keyboard will allow you enter insert mode. This allows you to type text and keyboard input to the open file.</li>\n<li>Visual Mode - Pressing <code>v</code> on your keyboard will put you in visual mode. This allows you to highlight and use commands on highlighted syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: You can escape Insert and Visual mode to go back to Normal mode with <code>esc</code> key</em></p>\n<p>The other MEME you will always see about vim is you can’t exit it… just turn your computer off. Haha, but seriously exiting vim is probably my favorite thing and that brings us to the first thing to remember:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If something is slow in vim, there is a way to do it faster in vim”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The official way to save and quit vim is to press the following in normal mode: <code>:wq</code> or faster <code>:x</code> or even faster <code>ZZ</code></p>\n<p>To quit without saving: <code>:q!</code> or faster <code>ZQ</code></p>\n<p>VIM Cheatsheets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devhints.io/vim\">https://devhints.io/vim</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vim.rtorr.com/\">https://vim.rtorr.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote data-sanitized-class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Created a cheatsheet to sit on my background.<br>Handy if you are starting to learn vim. <a href=\"https://t.co/dM6cl3ebho\">pic.twitter.com/dM6cl3ebho</a></p>— Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christitustech/status/1577690702200590336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"learning-the-basics\">Learning the basics</h2>\n<p>Now that you can actually function inside of vim, you might be thinking… “How in the hell do elite programmers use this damn program so fast?”.</p>\n<p>Movement and muscle memory are the biggest things with vim. It’s not just knowing the keys, but using them without thinking. This may seem impossible, but the more you practice the better you will get.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of <code>vimtutor</code> which walks you through the basics of vim. However, I’d encourage you to treat it like speed runners of your favorite video game. Run <code>vimtutor</code> as often as you can and treat it like a video game. How fast can you run it? Can you beat the old time? Can you complete the entire thing for the first time?!</p>\n<p>This is where you will pick up the speed. Between the constant cheatsheets and running <code>vimtutor</code> as often as possible.</p>\n<p>Other tips are moving as much of your workflow into vim as possible and customizing it to <strong>YOUR</strong> needs. Don’t just copy and paste some vimrc file your favorite programmer uses… it’s made for that person NOT YOU!</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"making-vim-your-own\">Making VIM your own</h2>\n<p>It is time to elevate your game to the elite status and making your own <code>.vimrc</code> file. This is where you make it feel awesome, even if you still suck at using vim. It’s important that you make vim feel good as this will make you want to continue using it.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using VIM for a month and this is my <code>.vimrc</code> file. I use a lot of plugins, themes, and just a few hotkeys. This isn’t what an experts .vimrc file looks like, as I still consider myself just now leaving the beginner stages into an intermediate user. As time goes on I will expand this file by adding more shortcuts and better hotkeys.</p>\n<p>Source: <a

beloved, but often misunderstood editors in existence. Let’s configure it from a noobs perspective and show you it’s power.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"why-vim\">Why VIM?</h2>\n<p>There is so many things to learn about VIM, but before we start the question often pops up why not just use VS Code or IntelliJ?</p>\n<p>VS Code and IntelliJ have some fantastic ease of use, and great debugging capabilities. There is extension support to add some amazing functionality. So why do many programmers still use VIM? one word: SPEED!</p>\n<p>There is nothing that can even compare when it comes to speed from a veteran VIM user. They will blaze through code at the speed of light and change so much on their screen that you will have a hard time following just watching it. Don’t believe me? Just watch ANY “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen/videos\">The Primeagen</a>” videos</p>\n<p>So if it’s so fast why don’t most people use VIM? It’s hard and has one of the biggest learning curves that I have ever seen from any program. It will take <strong>YEARS</strong> to master, months to be better than vs code/intellij editors, and weeks of learning to be comparable to any other editor on the market.</p>\n<p>However, the payoff is beyond worth it to me. The reward feels so good when you start to <em>get</em> it. The big thing… you can throw your mouse away, because when you get it… a mouse is no longer needed.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"beginning-steps\">Beginning steps</h2>\n<p>The very first thing you need to know about vim is the modes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Normal Mode - The default mode you enter into on launch. This allows quick movement, exiting, commands, but you don’t “type” in this mode.</li>\n<li>Insert Mode - Pressing <code>i</code> on your keyboard will allow you enter insert mode. This allows you to type text and keyboard input to the open file.</li>\n<li>Visual Mode - Pressing <code>v</code> on your keyboard will put you in visual mode. This allows you to highlight and use commands on highlighted syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: You can escape Insert and Visual mode to go back to Normal mode with <code>esc</code> key</em></p>\n<p>The other MEME you will always see about vim is you can’t exit it… just turn your computer off. Haha, but seriously exiting vim is probably my favorite thing and that brings us to the first thing to remember:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If something is slow in vim, there is a way to do it faster in vim”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The official way to save and quit vim is to press the following in normal mode: <code>:wq</code> or faster <code>:x</code> or even faster <code>ZZ</code></p>\n<p>To quit without saving: <code>:q!</code> or faster <code>ZQ</code></p>\n<p>VIM Cheatsheets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devhints.io/vim\">https://devhints.io/vim</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vim.rtorr.com/\">https://vim.rtorr.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote data-sanitized-class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Created a cheatsheet to sit on my background.<br>Handy if you are starting to learn vim. <a href=\"https://t.co/dM6cl3ebho\">pic.twitter.com/dM6cl3ebho</a></p>— Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christitustech/status/1577690702200590336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"learning-the-basics\">Learning the basics</h2>\n<p>Now that you can actually function inside of vim, you might be thinking… “How in the hell do elite programmers use this damn program so fast?”.</p>\n<p>Movement and muscle memory are the biggest things with vim. It’s not just knowing the keys, but using them without thinking. This may seem impossible, but the more you practice the better you will get.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of <code>vimtutor</code> which walks you through the basics of vim. However, I’d encourage you to treat it like speed runners of your favorite video game. Run <code>vimtutor</code> as often as you can and treat it like a video game. How fast can you run it? Can you beat the old time? Can you complete the entire thing for the first time?!</p>\n<p>This is where you will pick up the speed. Between the constant cheatsheets and running <code>vimtutor</code> as often as possible.</p>\n<p>Other tips are moving as much of your workflow into vim as possible and customizing it to <strong>YOUR</strong> needs. Don’t just copy and paste some vimrc file your favorite programmer uses… it’s made for that person NOT YOU!</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"making-vim-your-own\">Making VIM your own</h2>\n<p>It is time to elevate your game to the elite status and making your own <code>.vimrc</code> file. This is where you make it feel awesome, even if you still suck at using vim. It’s important that you make vim feel good as this will make you want to continue using it.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using VIM for a month and this is my <code>.vimrc</code> file. I use a lot of plugins, themes, and just a few hotkeys. This isn’t what an experts .vimrc file looks like, as I still consider myself just now leaving the beginner stages into an intermediate user. As time goes on I will expand this file by adding more shortcuts and better hotkeys.</p>\n<p>Source: <a

I just had a project pop up where I’d have to spend hours finding and replacing a complex markdown line I was using to pull images and a video link. The solution was painfully obvious… either I get better with RegEx or spend hours finding and replacing text in hundreds of posts.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"understanding-regex\">Understanding RegEx</h2>\n<p>Learning all the syntax for RegEx is not happening for me and probably many others. There is a solution for this and you don’t need to… <a href=\"https://regexr.com/\">https://regexr.com/</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/regex/text-example.png\" alt=\"text-example\"></p>\n<p>Now that you have an explainer of all the syntax and cheat sheet. We just need to know a few basic features of RegEx, so you can perfect the pattern that you need. Also, the need to understand groups and variables will make the find and replace much more powerful.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"making-the-perfect-pattern\">Making the Perfect Pattern</h2>\n<p>With our test example on regexr.com we can test our pattern to make sure we match exactly what we need. Now normally a guide would start talking about <code>.*</code> and other match characters, but frankly any site like regexr or regex101.com, will have those laid out for you.</p>\n<p>Instead, let’s talk about escaping characters and how to match weird expressions that have syntax like <code>[,(,+,?</code> and more. All these can really mess up matching your pattern. So you need to <em>escape</em> the with a <code>\\</code> before the symbol, so it would look something like this <code>\\[blah\\]</code> this is regex speak for <code>[blah]</code> the escaping character makes it actually register the bracket or parenthesis. Without it, it will probably just give you some syntax error.</p>\n<p>The websites I gave above are perfect for pointing out flaws in your pattern or maybe you missed escaping that + sign or question mark.

I just had a project pop up where I’d have to spend hours finding and replacing a complex markdown line I was using to pull images and a video link. The solution was painfully obvious… either I get better with RegEx or spend hours finding and replacing text in hundreds of posts.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"understanding-regex\">Understanding RegEx</h2>\n<p>Learning all the syntax for RegEx is not happening for me and probably many others. There is a solution for this and you don’t need to… <a href=\"https://regexr.com/\">https://regexr.com/</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/regex/text-example.png\" alt=\"text-example\"></p>\n<p>Now that you have an explainer of all the syntax and cheat sheet. We just need to know a few basic features of RegEx, so you can perfect the pattern that you need. Also, the need to understand groups and variables will make the find and replace much more powerful.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"making-the-perfect-pattern\">Making the Perfect Pattern</h2>\n<p>With our test example on regexr.com we can test our pattern to make sure we match exactly what we need. Now normally a guide would start talking about <code>.*</code> and other match characters, but frankly any site like regexr or regex101.com, will have those laid out for you.</p>\n<p>Instead, let’s talk about escaping characters and how to match weird expressions that have syntax like <code>[,(,+,?</code> and more. All these can really mess up matching your pattern. So you need to <em>escape</em> the with a <code>\\</code> before the symbol, so it would look something like this <code>\\[blah\\]</code> this is regex speak for <code>[blah]</code> the escaping character makes it actually register the bracket or parenthesis. Without it, it will probably just give you some syntax error.</p>\n<p>The websites I gave above are perfect for pointing out flaws in your pattern or maybe you missed escaping that + sign or question mark.

The creator made 5 packages that you need to install before you can use it.

However, over the past several years I’ve tried almost every Distribution that you can choose. There are some that I have not installed, because it was just more of the same.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/choose-linux-distribution/distros.png\" alt=\"distros\"></p>\n<p>To start with there is a misconception that there is thousands of choices in Linux Distributions. While technically true, there is really only 3 distributions you need to know about for desktop use, but before we get into that you need to know about what makes up a distribution. This is mandatory to understand why there is so many different ones that splinter off of these three.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"what-is-in-a-distribution\">What is in a Distribution</h2>\n<p>Windows and Mac are called Operating Systems, NOT distributions… but in Linux this isn’t the case. Why? That is because each Linux offering has different options at its core. With Windows and Mac you always get the same bootloader, file manager, etc. and in Linux these can differ drastically from one to the next. So this is what makes up the Linux distribution.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"bootloader\">Bootloader</h3>\n<p>This can is usually either GRUB or systemd-boot. This may not mean much to you, but i’ll explain the difference. GRUB has been around for ages and can be themed while having a ton of flexibility. It supports UEFI and Legacy, while systemd-boot is pretty much included with every modern linux distribution and only boots via UEFI and has a limited menu system. I highly encourage you that want a themed multi-boot system to check out my Top 5 Bootloader project that auto-installs multiple themes: <a href=\"https://christitus.com/bootloader-themes/\">https://christitus.com/bootloader-themes/</a></p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"init-system\">Init System</h3>\n<p>When your system is initializing on startup it needs to verify all the devices it will use and get the system ready for boot. Almost every Linux system these days use systemd. Systemd is very big and inclusive, but to many is bloated. It does much more than just initializing the system. It has Timers, bootloader, services, and much more. I did a YouTube video explaining everything in systemd if you want to learn more. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hc7J-zWEty8\">https://youtu.be/hc7J-zWEty8</a>\nThere is other options out there for Linux and certain fringe distributions that use them, but if you want other options check out init.d and precursors to systemd. They are much faster and if looking at building an ultimate minimal system this is the route to take.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"display-render\">Display Render</h3>\n<p>To draw graphics on the screen we need a render. There are only two major ones you need to know about. Wayland and Xorg. Wayland is the new kid that should be faster and better, but is lacking features and compatibility. Xorg is the old, wise man that just works, but is starting to show its age. To me, I always choose Xorg because Wayland always runs into problems. Xorg has two features that Wayland is lacking for me right now. It has X11 forwarding for running GUI programs remotely through an SSH connection and using legacy programs for sharing a keyboard/mouse across screens using synergy/barrier. I did a video on this here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Fci_ALdEzGc\">https://youtu.be/Fci_ALdEzGc</a>. To many it simply doesn’t matter, because they both fundamentally do the same thing.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"display-manager\">Display Manager</h3>\n<p>This really should be called a Login Manager or user selector, but in Linux the entire ecosystem is run by extremely smart technical people, that just so happen to be terrible at marketing. So the “Display Manager” comes in many flavors and this is where we start to run into many personal options in Distributions. Personally, I really don’t care about this, but there are three main ones that are used and can be configured differently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lightdm</li>\n<li>sddm</li>\n<li>gdm\nWhile there are others, these three pretty much are always chosen for a distribution. SDDM is generally bundled with KDE systems (which we will get into here in a bit), GDM is for GNOME systems, and lightdm (my personal fav) is pretty much a catch all.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"desktop-environments\">Desktop Environments</h3>\n<p>Think of Desktop Environments as the tools that make up the control center in an Operating System. Want to change the display resolution, theme, colors, fonts, etc. well all that stuff is in the desktop environment. Now you don’t technically need a full blow DE with all this stuff. The main thing you do need is a Window Manager to control where windows are placed. With all that said lets layout the common DEs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GNOME</li>\n<li>KDE</li>\n<li>XFCE</li>\n<li>Window Managers</li>\n<li>and many, many, more. \nThis could be a 100 page manual with all the options, but I want to give you the basics. GNOME gives more of a mac-esque style and KDE gives that windows look and feed. XFCE is more bare-bones with the essential tools and not much else. Where a basic “window manager” is just the window manager without any utilities. You might think… “How the hell do you change the resolution? or font? with a window manger…” This is accomplished either by hard coding it in to the configuration files or by installing an independent utility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"package-managers\">Package Managers</h3>\n<p>This is how distributions install programs. Here are the major ones you need to know about.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>APT - Debian distros <code>apt install programname</code></li>\n<li>DNF / YUM - RHEL distros <code>dnf install programname</code></li>\n<li>Pacman - Arch distros <code>pacman -S programname</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"distributions\">Distributions</h2>\n<p>So now that you know what they are made up of we can easily get to deciding what you really want your computing experience to be like. Figure out what components above you like and do NOT like. Then swap them out for something better. The main gripe I have with Windows and Mac is I find their file manager absolutely terrible.

You will also understand why all the top 5 distros and other Linux garbage on the internet is worthless. That is because there is no perfect distro, however there is the perfect distro for YOU! It just so happens that it is different for each user and you have the options that no other system on earth give you with Linux.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"walkthrough-video\">Walkthrough Video</h2>\n\n<div>\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dL05DoJ0qsQ\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"></iframe>\n</div>","content":"<p>Choosing a Linux distribution can be difficult, especially if you don’t know much about Linux. However, over the past several years I’ve tried almost every Distribution that you can choose. There are some that I have not installed, because it was just more of the same.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/choose-linux-distribution/distros.png\" alt=\"distros\"></p>\n<p>To start with there is a misconception that there is thousands of choices in Linux Distributions. While technically true, there is really only 3 distributions you need to know about for desktop use, but before we get into that you need to know about what makes up a distribution. This is mandatory to understand why there is so many different ones that splinter off of these three.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"what-is-in-a-distribution\">What is in a Distribution</h2>\n<p>Windows and Mac are called Operating Systems, NOT distributions… but in Linux this isn’t the case. Why? That is because each Linux offering has different options at its core. With Windows and Mac you always get the same bootloader, file manager, etc. and in Linux these can differ drastically from one to the next. So this is what makes up the Linux distribution.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"bootloader\">Bootloader</h3>\n<p>This can is usually either GRUB or systemd-boot. This may not mean much to you, but i’ll explain the difference. GRUB has been around for ages and can be themed while having a ton of flexibility. It supports UEFI and Legacy, while systemd-boot is pretty much included with every modern linux distribution and only boots via UEFI and has a limited menu system. I highly encourage you that want a themed multi-boot system to check out my Top 5 Bootloader project that auto-installs multiple themes: <a href=\"https://christitus.com/bootloader-themes/\">https://christitus.com/bootloader-themes/</a></p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"init-system\">Init System</h3>\n<p>When your system is initializing on startup it needs to verify all the devices it will use and get the system ready for boot. Almost every Linux system these days use systemd. Systemd is very big and inclusive, but to many is bloated. It does much more than just initializing the system. It has Timers, bootloader, services, and much more. I did a YouTube video explaining everything in systemd if you want to learn more. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hc7J-zWEty8\">https://youtu.be/hc7J-zWEty8</a>\nThere is other options out there for Linux and certain fringe distributions that use them, but if you want other options check out init.d and precursors to systemd. They are much faster and if looking at building an ultimate minimal system this is the route to take.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"display-render\">Display Render</h3>\n<p>To draw graphics on the screen we need a render. There are only two major ones you need to know about. Wayland and Xorg. Wayland is the new kid that should be faster and better, but is lacking features and compatibility. Xorg is the old, wise man that just works, but is starting to show its age. To me, I always choose Xorg because Wayland always runs into problems. Xorg has two features that Wayland is lacking for me right now. It has X11 forwarding for running GUI programs remotely through an SSH connection and using legacy programs for sharing a keyboard/mouse across screens using synergy/barrier. I did a video on this here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Fci_ALdEzGc\">https://youtu.be/Fci_ALdEzGc</a>. To many it simply doesn’t matter, because they both fundamentally do the same thing.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"display-manager\">Display Manager</h3>\n<p>This really should be called a Login Manager or user selector, but in Linux the entire ecosystem is run by extremely smart technical people, that just so happen to be terrible at marketing. So the “Display Manager” comes in many flavors and this is where we start to run into many personal options in Distributions. Personally, I really don’t care about this, but there are three main ones that are used and can be configured differently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lightdm</li>\n<li>sddm</li>\n<li>gdm\nWhile there are others, these three pretty much are always chosen for a distribution. SDDM is generally bundled with KDE systems (which we will get into here in a bit), GDM is for GNOME systems, and lightdm (my personal fav) is pretty much a catch all.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"desktop-environments\">Desktop Environments</h3>\n<p>Think of Desktop Environments as the tools that make up the control center in an Operating System. Want to change the display resolution, theme, colors, fonts, etc. well all that stuff is in the desktop environment. Now you don’t technically need a full blow DE with all this stuff. The main thing you do need is a Window Manager to control where windows are placed. With all that said lets layout the common DEs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GNOME</li>\n<li>KDE</li>\n<li>XFCE</li>\n<li>Window Managers</li>\n<li>and many, many, more. \nThis could be a 100 page manual with all the options, but I want to give you the basics. GNOME gives more of a mac-esque style and KDE gives that windows look and feed. XFCE is more bare-bones with the essential tools and not much else. Where a basic “window manager” is just the window manager without any utilities. You might think… “How the hell do you change the resolution? or font? with a window manger…” This is accomplished either by hard coding it in to the configuration files or by installing an independent utility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"package-managers\">Package Managers</h3>\n<p>This is how distributions install programs. Here are the major ones you need to know about.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>APT - Debian distros <code>apt install programname</code></li>\n<li>DNF / YUM - RHEL distros <code>dnf install programname</code></li>\n<li>Pacman - Arch distros <code>pacman -S programname</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"distributions\">Distributions</h2>\n<p>So now that you know what they are made up of we can easily get to deciding what you really want your computing experience to be like. Figure out what components above you like and do NOT like. Then swap them out for something better. The main gripe I have with Windows and Mac is I find their file manager absolutely terrible. I want to switch them and rip out the junk they give me, but we can’t as they are integral to the function of the operating system. In Linux, we get that freedom. Here are the three “distributions” that pretty much everything is based on and what the base package installs are.

How fast or how slow it will be, is determined by how popular it is with IPFS nodes. \nThis guide shows how to host a website, owning a web domain forever, and redirecting these domains to traditional website hosts.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"ipfs---a-better-storage-system\">IPFS - A Better Storage System</h2>\n<p>IPFS is absolutely amazing as you can run a node on anything and share your files. If they are used by other people then they will populate to their nodes and I’ve shared and used video files over 1 GB in size! The main issue is there isn’t many browsers that support IPFS and it is slower than normal storage right now. However, you never have to worry about hosting costs and as long as the content is accessed by others on a regular basis it will live forever!</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"improving-ipfs-in-brave-browser\">Improving IPFS in Brave Browser</h3>\n<p>I highly recommend using IPFS Companion if you plan on doing this regularly. You don’t have to run your own node, but can that is up to you. Using this add-on will help resolve IPFS addresses much faster even in Gateway only mode.</p>\n<p>Enable IPFS Companion Extension</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/\">https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After installing IPFS Companion change the following brave settings under Settings -&gt; IPFS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable IPFS Public Gateway Fallback (Not Required, but recommended)</li>\n<li>Enable IPFS Companion \n<img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/future-internet/ipfs-settings.png\" alt=\"ipfs-settings\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enable Blockchain domains - The Unstoppable Domains extension (In the future, this should be baked into many browsers.

I’m more interested in actually using the blockchain and where all the meta data lives for decentralized web or Web3. So what blockchains have I used for this? Lets review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum was one of the original ones that is incredible slow and expensive. I feel like this has turned from a usable blockchain into something only millionaires can use. Maybe this will change in the future, but right now it isn’t usable because of the cost to submit transactions. ENS Domains uses ethereum.</li>\n<li>Polygon is a bridge blockchain that drastically improves upon what ethereum started. Fees are non-existent and is very functional. Transfer times are generally about a minute. This is currently what unstoppable domains uses.</li>\n<li>Solana is not something I recommend, but is considered the fastest blockchain out there. However, It has crashed multiple times and halted completely. I am also skeptical that is even decentralized with the problems it has had. It is very easy to work on and something to watch.</li>\n<li>Cardano is probably my favorite out of all these blockchains for the future. It is very decentralized, transactions can be as fast as 20 seconds and up to a couple minutes. Its roadmap is probably the most promising blockchain with future transactions hitting upwards of 10,000+ transactions per second in a decentralized format. Another possible chain that can be used in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"buying-websites-forever\">Buying Websites Forever</h2>\n<p>Currently ens domains requires renewing websites, while unstoppable domains provides them forever. This entire space is exploding, so getting a good name is becoming more and more difficult just like the traditional web. There is a very healthy resale market on Opensea.io that folks are using to squat or resell domains purchased through unstoppable domains. If adoption keeps moving this direction, we will soon see some pretty ridiculous prices on domain names. Buying direct from unstoppable domains ranges from $10 to $100 per domain name, depending on domain ending. \n<img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/future-internet/domains.png\" alt=\"domains\"></p>\n<p>Here is discount link for unstoppable if you are interested in picking up a domain: <a href=\"https://unstoppabledomains.pxf.io/MX3zVM\">https://unstoppabledomains.pxf.io/MX3zVM</a></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"uploading-static-sites\">Uploading Static Sites</h2>\n<p>Hosting your website through unstoppable domains is pretty easy, but just know you are limited on size if using their uploader.

How fast or how slow it will be, is determined by how popular it is with IPFS nodes. \nThis guide shows how to host a website, owning a web domain forever, and redirecting these domains to traditional website hosts.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"ipfs---a-better-storage-system\">IPFS - A Better Storage System</h2>\n<p>IPFS is absolutely amazing as you can run a node on anything and share your files. If they are used by other people then they will populate to their nodes and I’ve shared and used video files over 1 GB in size! The main issue is there isn’t many browsers that support IPFS and it is slower than normal storage right now. However, you never have to worry about hosting costs and as long as the content is accessed by others on a regular basis it will live forever!</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"improving-ipfs-in-brave-browser\">Improving IPFS in Brave Browser</h3>\n<p>I highly recommend using IPFS Companion if you plan on doing this regularly. You don’t have to run your own node, but can that is up to you. Using this add-on will help resolve IPFS addresses much faster even in Gateway only mode.</p>\n<p>Enable IPFS Companion Extension</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/\">https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After installing IPFS Companion change the following brave settings under Settings -&gt; IPFS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable IPFS Public Gateway Fallback (Not Required, but recommended)</li>\n<li>Enable IPFS Companion \n<img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/future-internet/ipfs-settings.png\" alt=\"ipfs-settings\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enable Blockchain domains - The Unstoppable Domains extension (In the future, this should be baked into many browsers.

I’m more interested in actually using the blockchain and where all the meta data lives for decentralized web or Web3. So what blockchains have I used for this? Lets review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum was one of the original ones that is incredible slow and expensive. I feel like this has turned from a usable blockchain into something only millionaires can use. Maybe this will change in the future, but right now it isn’t usable because of the cost to submit transactions. ENS Domains uses ethereum.</li>\n<li>Polygon is a bridge blockchain that drastically improves upon what ethereum started. Fees are non-existent and is very functional. Transfer times are generally about a minute. This is currently what unstoppable domains uses.</li>\n<li>Solana is not something I recommend, but is considered the fastest blockchain out there. However, It has crashed multiple times and halted completely. I am also skeptical that is even decentralized with the problems it has had. It is very easy to work on and something to watch.</li>\n<li>Cardano is probably my favorite out of all these blockchains for the future. It is very decentralized, transactions can be as fast as 20 seconds and up to a couple minutes. Its roadmap is probably the most promising blockchain with future transactions hitting upwards of 10,000+ transactions per second in a decentralized format. Another possible chain that can be used in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"buying-websites-forever\">Buying Websites Forever</h2>\n<p>Currently ens domains requires renewing websites, while unstoppable domains provides them forever. This entire space is exploding, so getting a good name is becoming more and more difficult just like the traditional web. There is a very healthy resale market on Opensea.io that folks are using to squat or resell domains purchased through unstoppable domains. If adoption keeps moving this direction, we will soon see some pretty ridiculous prices on domain names. Buying direct from unstoppable domains ranges from $10 to $100 per domain name, depending on domain ending. \n<img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/future-internet/domains.png\" alt=\"domains\"></p>\n<p>Here is discount link for unstoppable if you are interested in picking up a domain: <a href=\"https://unstoppabledomains.pxf.io/MX3zVM\">https://unstoppabledomains.pxf.io/MX3zVM</a></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"uploading-static-sites\">Uploading Static Sites</h2>\n<p>Hosting your website through unstoppable domains is pretty easy, but just know you are limited on size if using their uploader.

They are wildly volatile speculative assets that’s valuation will swing wildly from one moment to the next. However, This article isn’t about how much its worth or how much it will be worth. This is about it’s practical application and how it will change the world we live in. Just by having this knowledge you will be able to profit and be ready for that future.</p>\n<p>Practical application of crypto is all over our society today. Many banks are using it, and wealthy individuals are utilizing it. Here are the ways it is used today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>International Bank transfers (Ripple) - Long wire delays and intermediary banking is becoming a relic of the past. Banks can leverage it to make trustless transfers between banks in seconds around the world.</li>\n<li>International Money Transfers (Bitcoin) - Want to send money to a relative in a different nation? Well using Bitcoin is probably the easiest way to get this done with almost no fees. You could send $1000 for less than $1 fee.</li>\n<li>Banking Replacement (Yield Farming) - Some companies are providing loans and holding crypto while passing along a profits to those holding crypto with them. Think of a savings account on steroids or collateral loans.</li>\n<li>Synthetic Assets (Synthetix) - What to trade Apple stock, gold, or other assets that exist? Sythetic assets are tracked using the blockchain and traded either for the said asset or for the dollar amount the asset is worth.</li>\n<li>Send Private Transactions (Monero) - Send money between two entities completely that is completely private. <em>Please note: Bitcoin and other projects are actively tracked, while some are still privacy oriented, much like physical cash.</em></li>\n<li>Insurance, Data Backup, and all kinds of data that you will always want a ledger of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/wallet.png\" alt=\"wallet\"></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"how-to-store-crypto\">How to Store Crypto</h2>\n<p>There are two ways of thinking about storing crypto. You can either hold it all yourself or you can use a custodian where you rely on a company to hold it for you, much like a bank. Let’s address both ways:</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"storing-crypto-in-your-wallet\">Storing Crypto in Your Wallet</h3>\n<p>There are digital wallets where you can safely store your crypto and access it.

They are wildly volatile speculative assets that’s valuation will swing wildly from one moment to the next. However, This article isn’t about how much its worth or how much it will be worth. This is about it’s practical application and how it will change the world we live in. Just by having this knowledge you will be able to profit and be ready for that future.</p>\n<p>Practical application of crypto is all over our society today. Many banks are using it, and wealthy individuals are utilizing it. Here are the ways it is used today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>International Bank transfers (Ripple) - Long wire delays and intermediary banking is becoming a relic of the past. Banks can leverage it to make trustless transfers between banks in seconds around the world.</li>\n<li>International Money Transfers (Bitcoin) - Want to send money to a relative in a different nation? Well using Bitcoin is probably the easiest way to get this done with almost no fees. You could send $1000 for less than $1 fee.</li>\n<li>Banking Replacement (Yield Farming) - Some companies are providing loans and holding crypto while passing along a profits to those holding crypto with them. Think of a savings account on steroids or collateral loans.</li>\n<li>Synthetic Assets (Synthetix) - What to trade Apple stock, gold, or other assets that exist? Sythetic assets are tracked using the blockchain and traded either for the said asset or for the dollar amount the asset is worth.</li>\n<li>Send Private Transactions (Monero) - Send money between two entities completely that is completely private. <em>Please note: Bitcoin and other projects are actively tracked, while some are still privacy oriented, much like physical cash.</em></li>\n<li>Insurance, Data Backup, and all kinds of data that you will always want a ledger of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/wallet.png\" alt=\"wallet\"></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"how-to-store-crypto\">How to Store Crypto</h2>\n<p>There are two ways of thinking about storing crypto.

Currently, the GNOME, XFCE, MATE, Unity, and Cinnamon Desktop Environments should be automatically detected and the program should set the wallpaper without any extra work. However, due to the varying nature of window managers, it is possible, even likely, that you may have to specify a custom command to set your wallpaper. The program will prompt you for this if this is the case; the exact command can be researched per desktop environment. If your desktop environment is not supported, leave the set command blank and it will auto download to the <code>~/Pictures/Wallpapers/</code> directory as wallpaper.jpg for the daily wallpaper.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"config-options\">Config Options</h3>\n<p><code>minwidth</code> and <code>minheight</code> set the minimum dimensions the program will consider a valid candidate for a wallpaper.

However, once I figured out the SVG format can be edited in a simple text editor and I mirrored the size and types from the existing SVG files they showed up.</p>\n<p>Here are the Edits I made to <em>social.html</em>:</p>\n<div data-sanitized-class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-sanitized-class=\"chroma\"><code data-lang=\"fallback\" data-sanitized-class=\"language-fallback\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">{{- with .Site.Params.widgets.social.twitch }}\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">\t\t&lt;div class=\"widget-social__item widget__item\"&gt;\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">\t\t\t&lt;a class=\"widget-social__link widget__link btn\" title=\"Twitch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://twitch.tv/{{ . }}\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">\t\t\t\t{{ partial \"svg/twitch.svg\" (dict \"class\" \"widget-social__link-icon\") }}\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">\t\t\t\t&lt;span&gt;Twitch Live Streams&lt;/span&gt;\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">\t\t\t&lt;/a&gt;\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">\t\t&lt;/div&gt;\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">\t\t{{- end }}\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Basically after getting the SVG setup and putting the twitch.svg and youtube.svg in this path <code>siteroot/mainroad/layouts/partials/svg</code> I was able to get the Social widget exactly how I wanted.</p>\n<h5 data-sanitized-id=\"tags-widget\">Tags Widget</h5>\n<p>Next up was fixing the tags on the sidebar. They were blocky and quite ugly, where I wanted a traditional tag cloud that you see on many other sites to help users navigate your content.

You can leave the stock, but I wanted to add a privacy policy and terms of service to be compliant.</p>\n<h4 data-sanitized-id=\"table-of-contents-changes\">Table of Contents Changes</h4>\n<p>I replaced the title “PAGE CONTENTS” with share buttons using a share-buttons.html I created. This could all be done in the post-toc.html file, but I wanted to keep it modular and not make too many edits to the theme.

You could put Analytics in here as well, but it isn’t needed since mainroad theme has the option in <code>config.toml</code>.

Even though this says localhost it is forwarding the request through SSH to the remote machine.</p>\n<p>Now with that framework lets look at the conf file:</p>\n<div data-sanitized-class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-sanitized-class=\"chroma\"><code data-lang=\"fallback\" data-sanitized-class=\"language-fallback\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\"># VNC Server configuration\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\"># enabled = True if VNC connections should be allowed\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\"># command = Command to run Xvnc server with\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\"># port = TCP/IP port to listen for connections on\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\"># listen-address = Host/address to listen for VNC connections (use all addresses if not present)\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\"># width = Width of display to use\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\"># height = Height of display to use\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\"># depth = Color depth of display to use\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">[VNCServer]\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#enabled=false\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#command=Xvnc\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#port=5900\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#listen-address=\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#width=1024\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#height=768\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">#depth=8\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The main things to change here are <code>enabled=true</code> <code>width - height - depth</code> and then you are off.

Let’s configure it from a noobs perspective and show you it’s power.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"why-vim\">Why VIM?</h2>\n<p>There is so many things to learn about VIM, but before we start the question often pops up why not just use VS Code or IntelliJ?</p>\n<p>VS Code and IntelliJ have some fantastic ease of use, and great debugging capabilities. There is extension support to add some amazing functionality. So why do many programmers still use VIM? one word: SPEED!</p>\n<p>There is nothing that can even compare when it comes to speed from a veteran VIM user. They will blaze through code at the speed of light and change so much on their screen that you will have a hard time following just watching it. Don’t believe me? Just watch ANY “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen/videos\">The Primeagen</a>” videos</p>\n<p>So if it’s so fast why don’t most people use VIM? It’s hard and has one of the biggest learning curves that I have ever seen from any program. It will take <strong>YEARS</strong> to master, months to be better than vs code/intellij editors, and weeks of learning to be comparable to any other editor on the market.</p>\n<p>However, the payoff is beyond worth it to me. The reward feels so good when you start to <em>get</em> it. The big thing… you can throw your mouse away, because when you get it… a mouse is no longer needed.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"beginning-steps\">Beginning steps</h2>\n<p>The very first thing you need to know about vim is the modes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Normal Mode - The default mode you enter into on launch. This allows quick movement, exiting, commands, but you don’t “type” in this mode.</li>\n<li>Insert Mode - Pressing <code>i</code> on your keyboard will allow you enter insert mode. This allows you to type text and keyboard input to the open file.</li>\n<li>Visual Mode - Pressing <code>v</code> on your keyboard will put you in visual mode. This allows you to highlight and use commands on highlighted syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: You can escape Insert and Visual mode to go back to Normal mode with <code>esc</code> key</em></p>\n<p>The other MEME you will always see about vim is you can’t exit it… just turn your computer off. Haha, but seriously exiting vim is probably my favorite thing and that brings us to the first thing to remember:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If something is slow in vim, there is a way to do it faster in vim”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The official way to save and quit vim is to press the following in normal mode: <code>:wq</code> or faster <code>:x</code> or even faster <code>ZZ</code></p>\n<p>To quit without saving: <code>:q!</code> or faster <code>ZQ</code></p>\n<p>VIM Cheatsheets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devhints.io/vim\">https://devhints.io/vim</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vim.rtorr.com/\">https://vim.rtorr.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote data-sanitized-class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Created a cheatsheet to sit on my background.<br>Handy if you are starting to learn vim. <a href=\"https://t.co/dM6cl3ebho\">pic.twitter.com/dM6cl3ebho</a></p>— Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christitustech/status/1577690702200590336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"learning-the-basics\">Learning the basics</h2>\n<p>Now that you can actually function inside of vim, you might be thinking… “How in the hell do elite programmers use this damn program so fast?”.</p>\n<p>Movement and muscle memory are the biggest things with vim. It’s not just knowing the keys, but using them without thinking. This may seem impossible, but the more you practice the better you will get.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of <code>vimtutor</code> which walks you through the basics of vim. However, I’d encourage you to treat it like speed runners of your favorite video game. Run <code>vimtutor</code> as often as you can and treat it like a video game. How fast can you run it? Can you beat the old time? Can you complete the entire thing for the first time?!</p>\n<p>This is where you will pick up the speed. Between the constant cheatsheets and running <code>vimtutor</code> as often as possible.</p>\n<p>Other tips are moving as much of your workflow into vim as possible and customizing it to <strong>YOUR</strong> needs. Don’t just copy and paste some vimrc file your favorite programmer uses… it’s made for that person NOT YOU!</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"making-vim-your-own\">Making VIM your own</h2>\n<p>It is time to elevate your game to the elite status and making your own <code>.vimrc</code> file. This is where you make it feel awesome, even if you still suck at using vim. It’s important that you make vim feel good as this will make you want to continue using it.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using VIM for a month and this is my <code>.vimrc</code> file. I use a lot of plugins, themes, and just a few hotkeys. This isn’t what an experts .vimrc file looks like, as I still consider myself just now leaving the beginner stages into an intermediate user. As time goes on I will expand this file by adding more shortcuts and better hotkeys.</p>\n<p>Source: <a

beloved, but often misunderstood editors in existence. Let’s configure it from a noobs perspective and show you it’s power.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"why-vim\">Why VIM?</h2>\n<p>There is so many things to learn about VIM, but before we start the question often pops up why not just use VS Code or IntelliJ?</p>\n<p>VS Code and IntelliJ have some fantastic ease of use, and great debugging capabilities. There is extension support to add some amazing functionality. So why do many programmers still use VIM? one word: SPEED!</p>\n<p>There is nothing that can even compare when it comes to speed from a veteran VIM user. They will blaze through code at the speed of light and change so much on their screen that you will have a hard time following just watching it. Don’t believe me? Just watch ANY “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen/videos\">The Primeagen</a>” videos</p>\n<p>So if it’s so fast why don’t most people use VIM? It’s hard and has one of the biggest learning curves that I have ever seen from any program. It will take <strong>YEARS</strong> to master, months to be better than vs code/intellij editors, and weeks of learning to be comparable to any other editor on the market.</p>\n<p>However, the payoff is beyond worth it to me. The reward feels so good when you start to <em>get</em> it. The big thing… you can throw your mouse away, because when you get it… a mouse is no longer needed.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"beginning-steps\">Beginning steps</h2>\n<p>The very first thing you need to know about vim is the modes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Normal Mode - The default mode you enter into on launch. This allows quick movement, exiting, commands, but you don’t “type” in this mode.</li>\n<li>Insert Mode - Pressing <code>i</code> on your keyboard will allow you enter insert mode. This allows you to type text and keyboard input to the open file.</li>\n<li>Visual Mode - Pressing <code>v</code> on your keyboard will put you in visual mode. This allows you to highlight and use commands on highlighted syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: You can escape Insert and Visual mode to go back to Normal mode with <code>esc</code> key</em></p>\n<p>The other MEME you will always see about vim is you can’t exit it… just turn your computer off. Haha, but seriously exiting vim is probably my favorite thing and that brings us to the first thing to remember:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If something is slow in vim, there is a way to do it faster in vim”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The official way to save and quit vim is to press the following in normal mode: <code>:wq</code> or faster <code>:x</code> or even faster <code>ZZ</code></p>\n<p>To quit without saving: <code>:q!</code> or faster <code>ZQ</code></p>\n<p>VIM Cheatsheets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devhints.io/vim\">https://devhints.io/vim</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vim.rtorr.com/\">https://vim.rtorr.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote data-sanitized-class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Created a cheatsheet to sit on my background.<br>Handy if you are starting to learn vim. <a href=\"https://t.co/dM6cl3ebho\">pic.twitter.com/dM6cl3ebho</a></p>— Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christitustech/status/1577690702200590336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"learning-the-basics\">Learning the basics</h2>\n<p>Now that you can actually function inside of vim, you might be thinking… “How in the hell do elite programmers use this damn program so fast?”.</p>\n<p>Movement and muscle memory are the biggest things with vim. It’s not just knowing the keys, but using them without thinking. This may seem impossible, but the more you practice the better you will get.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of <code>vimtutor</code> which walks you through the basics of vim. However, I’d encourage you to treat it like speed runners of your favorite video game. Run <code>vimtutor</code> as often as you can and treat it like a video game. How fast can you run it? Can you beat the old time? Can you complete the entire thing for the first time?!</p>\n<p>This is where you will pick up the speed. Between the constant cheatsheets and running <code>vimtutor</code> as often as possible.</p>\n<p>Other tips are moving as much of your workflow into vim as possible and customizing it to <strong>YOUR</strong> needs. Don’t just copy and paste some vimrc file your favorite programmer uses… it’s made for that person NOT YOU!</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"making-vim-your-own\">Making VIM your own</h2>\n<p>It is time to elevate your game to the elite status and making your own <code>.vimrc</code> file. This is where you make it feel awesome, even if you still suck at using vim. It’s important that you make vim feel good as this will make you want to continue using it.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using VIM for a month and this is my <code>.vimrc</code> file. I use a lot of plugins, themes, and just a few hotkeys. This isn’t what an experts .vimrc file looks like, as I still consider myself just now leaving the beginner stages into an intermediate user. As time goes on I will expand this file by adding more shortcuts and better hotkeys.</p>\n<p>Source: <a

Thank you Nik for sharing! It felt only right to share his thoughtful email with a lot of explanations that are hard to find on the net.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"launchd\">launchd</h2>\n<p>Launchd is Darwin/MacOS’s init system. The init portion of systemd is heavily modeled after launchd, but unlike systemd, launchd isn’t a monolithic system manager but only an init system. It’s a relatively simple design that follows the unix philosophy. Any further functionality is implemented by daemons that can be disabled with a launchd override plist.</p>\n<p>For info how to use launchd, check the man pages and read this document from the documentation archive: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html\">https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html</a></p>\n<p>You might also want to take a look at the launchd source code for a deeper understanding.</p>\n<p>I use Xcode’s graphical plist editor to configure daemons because I find it less annoying than editing XML with vim, but there are also light weight plist editors that don’t require you to start big ol Xcode every time you want to change something in a daemon.</p>\n<p>Job scheduling can be done either with launchd’s native tools or with cron.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"xnu\">XNU</h2>\n<p>XNU is Darwin’s kernel. It has a fascinating design and I highly recommend reading the source code. It’s a hybrid kernel that uses the Mach microkernel as its foundation and adds a BSD layer derived from FreeBSD and NetBSD on top to provide UNIX functionality. They are slowly turning XNU into more of a microkernel by moving drivers into the userland.</p>\n<p>The nvram utility can set bootflags. I generally run all my systems with verbose boot, and on some, I also tweak Mach scheduling. I also run a special bootflag on my (jailbroken) iPhone to keep kernel memory usage down so I can assign more memory to my phone’s needlessly complex launchd setup. You can find lists of bootflags with google, but might have to read kernel source code for the more obscure ones.</p>\n<p>Kernel sources for macOS 11 have not been released yet, so I assume it is currently not possible to compile a custom kernel for the M1 due to lack of drivers, but I haven’t tried it. The documentation archive contains a detailed overview of the kernel, but some of the information is outdated by now: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/About/About.html\">https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/About/About.html</a></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"smart-folders\">Smart Folders</h2>\n<p>You can save Finder searches as a so called smart folder, where the found files will be symlinked into the folder. This is useful for a lot of things, such as symlinking all files of a certain file format to the same folder, so you can have a Photos folder that will contain symlinks of all .png files on the system. The symlinks refresh automatically, so when ever you add a new .png somewhere to the filesystem, it would get symlinked to this folder.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"automator-and-folder-actions\">Automator and Folder Actions</h2>\n<p>You can create custom automation routines with automator. Automator also supports a variety of shell scripting languages such as Python or Bash. Automator actions can be used in a number of ways, such as an icon in your dock that runs the action on any file you drag onto it, or as a right click menu entry, or as a folder action. Folder actions bind automator scripts to folders and execute them on any file you put in the folder. You can for example combine the Bash support of Automator with ImageMagick or FFMPEG to automatically add watermarks to any photo or video you save to a specific folder.</p>\n<p>Automator also supports AppleScript, which is kind of a weird and arcane language, but offers many UI automization capabilities, that I frequently bind to voice commands for disability accommodation. It also integrates voiceover’s text-to-speech which I find incredibly useful to build notification systems for blind people. AppleScript functions can be called from Bash, so I usually just use Bash scripts and access AppleScript when I need it.</p>\n<p>There is also a paid third party automization tool called Keyboard Maestro, that is supposedly better than Automator, but I don’t have any experience with it.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"package-management\">Package Management</h2>\n<p>Pkgutil is Darwin’s native package manager. It does not support dependency resolution, and requires manual package removal, so it should only be used for things that you don’t want to uninstall like custom kernel extensions or patches. Darwin comes with the pkgbuild utility to create installable .pkg files from a root file structure, and can even build a customizable gui installer for them.</p>\n<p>My package management workflow is as follows:</p>\n<p>I use macports (an implementation of the BSD Ports System) for applications that have too many dependencies to build them manually.</p>\n<p>I use xbps (from void linux) to build and manage packages of unix utilities that I want to use across multiple systems. This is the one I use most. I used to use pacman, but xbps integrates git nicely, so I can just run a git server as my personal binary package repo, and pacman was too much of a headache to compile for mac, frankly. I will probably eventually transition to using macports for custom packages too, but xbps just makes it incredibly easy to build packages, and I’m already experienced with it because of void linux.</p>\n<p>I use pkgutil to build packages for kexts, launchd daemons and system tweaks that I want to use across multiple systems.</p>\n<p>I use a program’s included makefile for utilities that I only want to use on the system that I’m compiling them on.</p>\n<p>I’ve been considering building a custom binary package manager with Swift and plists to replace this workflow, but I don’t know if I’m actually gonna do that.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"directory-structure\">Directory Structure</h2>\n<p>The system partition is mounted as read-only in more recent versions of macOS, but if you want to tweak lower level stuff, you can either temporarily mount the partition with write privs with the standard mount command while in recovery mode, or run ‘csrutil disable’ in the recovery mode terminal to disable read-only mounting entirely. But make sure you keep timeshift backups around if you’re gonna mess with the system partition. I do not recommend that you ‘debloat’ macOS, and instead use launchd overrides to disable things like Find My Mac. Deleted system apps will just be reinstalled during updates, and they aren’t wasting resources while they aren’t loaded, so you don’t have much to gain except a few more megabytes of ssd space.</p>\n<p>Enable hidden files with command + shift + . and explore the file structure.</p>\n<p>User-installed unix utilities belong in /usr/local/bin.</p>\n<p>/usr/bin contains the default tools. FreeBSD’s cpuctl is included and works with the M1. This can be useful to disable all CPU cores except one of the power saving cores, as a custom ultra-low power mode on MacBooks, but there is also a boot flag to disable CPU cores. Another useful one is firmwarepasswd to password lock the bootloader. I use that + full drive encryption on devices that I take through airports. You might also want to check out diskutil and its manpage for command line partition management.</p>\n<p>/Applications contains your gui apps. You can drag this folder into your dock to get a much better grid view than launchpad, or right click on it to change it to a list view, which gives you something like the Windows 98 start menu. Applications are folders that you can explore by right clicking on them in finder or with the cd command. Applications don’t need to be in the /Applications directory to be run, so you can put them on an external drive. They will not show up in launchpad or the applications list in your dock if you place them somewhere else, but you can just symlink them from an external drive to /Applications. Spotlight will still be able to find apps even if they aren’t symlinked to /Applications. The Mac version of QuickTime is pretty great btw. The windows version has nothing in common with it except the name, so give it a chance if you were put off by your experience with it on windows.</p>\n<p>/Library contains settings plists and libraries.

All non-mini macs ship with either a touch pad or a mouse that has a touch surface, so where you would use gestures to control window management, but since you don’t have that, it would be good to bind it to buttons instead. Mouse 5 will show you all windows of the currently active application, and mouse 4 will show you all windows and virtual desktops. You can also set up hot corners to emulate Gnome and KDE’s window management.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"safari-adblocking\">Safari Adblocking</h2>\n<p>I need to use Safari because it’s the only browser with proper screen reader support. I like it over all for its performance, memory and battery efficiency, but an annoying issue is that there are no good adblockers for it because it restricts the level of access that extensions have to your traffic. AdGuard (not on the App Store) is a pretty decent alternative that works not only on MacOS but also Android and iOS and blocks ads systemwide, but a pihole would work too. I also run Little Snitch (also not on the App Store) for traffic monitoring.</p>","content":"<p>This comes from a reader that was a Sysadmin and transitioned from Linux to MacOS because of a visual impairment.</p>\n<p>He choose macOS because of it’s screen reader and shared all these tips, which I found extremely valuable. Thank you Nik for sharing! It felt only right to share his thoughtful email with a lot of explanations that are hard to find on the net.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"launchd\">launchd</h2>\n<p>Launchd is Darwin/MacOS’s init system. The init portion of systemd is heavily modeled after launchd, but unlike systemd, launchd isn’t a monolithic system manager but only an init system. It’s a relatively simple design that follows the unix philosophy. Any further functionality is implemented by daemons that can be disabled with a launchd override plist.</p>\n<p>For info how to use launchd, check the man pages and read this document from the documentation archive: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html\">https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html</a></p>\n<p>You might also want to take a look at the launchd source code for a deeper understanding.</p>\n<p>I use Xcode’s graphical plist editor to configure daemons because I find it less annoying than editing XML with vim, but there are also light weight plist editors that don’t require you to start big ol Xcode every time you want to change something in a daemon.</p>\n<p>Job scheduling can be done either with launchd’s native tools or with cron.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"xnu\">XNU</h2>\n<p>XNU is Darwin’s kernel. It has a fascinating design and I highly recommend reading the source code. It’s a hybrid kernel that uses the Mach microkernel as its foundation and adds a BSD layer derived from FreeBSD and NetBSD on top to provide UNIX functionality. They are slowly turning XNU into more of a microkernel by moving drivers into the userland.</p>\n<p>The nvram utility can set bootflags. I generally run all my systems with verbose boot, and on some, I also tweak Mach scheduling. I also run a special bootflag on my (jailbroken) iPhone to keep kernel memory usage down so I can assign more memory to my phone’s needlessly complex launchd setup. You can find lists of bootflags with google, but might have to read kernel source code for the more obscure ones.</p>\n<p>Kernel sources for macOS 11 have not been released yet, so I assume it is currently not possible to compile a custom kernel for the M1 due to lack of drivers, but I haven’t tried it. The documentation archive contains a detailed overview of the kernel, but some of the information is outdated by now: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/About/About.html\">https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/About/About.html</a></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"smart-folders\">Smart Folders</h2>\n<p>You can save Finder searches as a so called smart folder, where the found files will be symlinked into the folder. This is useful for a lot of things, such as symlinking all files of a certain file format to the same folder, so you can have a Photos folder that will contain symlinks of all .png files on the system. The symlinks refresh automatically, so when ever you add a new .png somewhere to the filesystem, it would get symlinked to this folder.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"automator-and-folder-actions\">Automator and Folder Actions</h2>\n<p>You can create custom automation routines with automator. Automator also supports a variety of shell scripting languages such as Python or Bash. Automator actions can be used in a number of ways, such as an icon in your dock that runs the action on any file you drag onto it, or as a right click menu entry, or as a folder action. Folder actions bind automator scripts to folders and execute them on any file you put in the folder. You can for example combine the Bash support of Automator with ImageMagick or FFMPEG to automatically add watermarks to any photo or video you save to a specific folder.</p>\n<p>Automator also supports AppleScript, which is kind of a weird and arcane language, but offers many UI automization capabilities, that I frequently bind to voice commands for disability accommodation. It also integrates voiceover’s text-to-speech which I find incredibly useful to build notification systems for blind people. AppleScript functions can be called from Bash, so I usually just use Bash scripts and access AppleScript when I need it.</p>\n<p>There is also a paid third party automization tool called Keyboard Maestro, that is supposedly better than Automator, but I don’t have any experience with it.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"package-management\">Package Management</h2>\n<p>Pkgutil is Darwin’s native package manager. It does not support dependency resolution, and requires manual package removal, so it should only be used for things that you don’t want to uninstall like custom kernel extensions or patches. Darwin comes with the pkgbuild utility to create installable .pkg files from a root file structure, and can even build a customizable gui installer for them.</p>\n<p>My package management workflow is as follows:</p>\n<p>I use macports (an implementation of the BSD Ports System) for applications that have too many dependencies to build them manually.</p>\n<p>I use xbps (from void linux) to build and manage packages of unix utilities that I want to use across multiple systems. This is the one I use most. I used to use pacman, but xbps integrates git nicely, so I can just run a git server as my personal binary package repo, and pacman was too much of a headache to compile for mac, frankly. I will probably eventually transition to using macports for custom packages too, but xbps just makes it incredibly easy to build packages, and I’m already experienced with it because of void linux.</p>\n<p>I use pkgutil to build packages for kexts, launchd daemons and system tweaks that I want to use across multiple systems.</p>\n<p>I use a program’s included makefile for utilities that I only want to use on the system that I’m compiling them on.</p>\n<p>I’ve been considering building a custom binary package manager with Swift and plists to replace this workflow, but I don’t know if I’m actually gonna do that.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"directory-structure\">Directory Structure</h2>\n<p>The system partition is mounted as read-only in more recent versions of macOS, but if you want to tweak lower level stuff, you can either temporarily mount the partition with write privs with the standard mount command while in recovery mode, or run ‘csrutil disable’ in the recovery mode terminal to disable read-only mounting entirely. But make sure you keep timeshift backups around if you’re gonna mess with the system partition. I do not recommend that you ‘debloat’ macOS, and instead use launchd overrides to disable things like Find My Mac. Deleted system apps will just be reinstalled during updates, and they aren’t wasting resources while they aren’t loaded, so you don’t have much to gain except a few more megabytes of ssd space.</p>\n<p>Enable hidden files with command + shift + . and explore the file structure.</p>\n<p>User-installed unix utilities belong in /usr/local/bin.</p>\n<p>/usr/bin contains the default tools. FreeBSD’s cpuctl is included and works with the M1. This can be useful to disable all CPU cores except one of the power saving cores, as a custom ultra-low power mode on MacBooks, but there is also a boot flag to disable CPU cores. Another useful one is firmwarepasswd to password lock the bootloader. I use that + full drive encryption on devices that I take through airports. You might also want to check out diskutil and its manpage for command line partition management.</p>\n<p>/Applications contains your gui apps. You can drag this folder into your dock to get a much better grid view than launchpad, or right click on it to change it to a list view, which gives you something like the Windows 98 start menu.

The program will prompt you for this if this is the case; the exact command can be researched per desktop environment.

There was a heated rivalry between Internet Exploader and Netscape, which Microsoft inevitably won with dirty business practices. That era was a time of discovery and businesses were figuring out how to make money on the internet.</p>\n<p>Information was scattered everywhere and the web was decentralized among hundreds of companies. When we “logged on” you made decisions on what to do. Sometimes you wanted to play a game, or stumble upon a new website, or browse a news group. Almost nothing curated and uniform. This is often referred to as Web 1.0.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"how-we-use-the-internet-today\">How we use the Internet today</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/why-we-dont-browse-the-internet-anymore/google.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We google anything we want, use our chromium browsers, and social media for everything else. Between Google, Facebook (I’m not calling it Meta), and Amazon we have everything. Facebook is dying off and for old people raging about some political garbage, Amazon we order anything want to appear on our doorstep, and Google is what powers almost every search we do.</p>\n<p>When we find the site we are looking for, it ends up with tons of ads or paywalled. Even worse, some reputable sites sell “sponsored posts” where the advertising gets posted directly in the feed. Imagine watching a television show and then in the third episode its nothing but a giant Subway ad. This is our modern internet.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"how-to-fix-it-with-rss\">How to fix it with RSS</h2>\n<p>Really Simple Syndication or RSS for short, is used to get updates from websites whenever something is posted. You have a listing of the entire website and you can pick the article you want to read. Even better you can subscribe to YouTube Channels and other social feeds to RSS as well.</p>\n<p>The problem? Ads, Brief Summaries, and redirects. We fix this by using a feed aggregator and never leave our RSS reader.</p>\n<p>The other problem with RSS Readers online are expensive using feedly($8), inoreader($10), and newsblur($3) per month. This used all be free with Google Reader, but in typical Google fashion they killed Reader.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"feed-aggregation\">Feed Aggregation</h3>\n<p>I use docker self-hosted aggregator <a href=\"https://github.com/heussd/fivefilters-full-text-rss-docker\">https://github.com/heussd/fivefilters-full-text-rss-docker</a> or if you want to pay money you can use <a href=\"http://ftr.fivefilters.org/\">five filters aggregator</a></p>\n<p>Here is my docker command to install and configure it on my docker server using port 50000</p>\n<div data-sanitized-class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-sanitized-class=\"chroma\"><code data-lang=\"fallback\" data-sanitized-class=\"language-fallback\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">docker run -d \\\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">--name=full-test-rss \\\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">-p 50000:80 \\\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">--restart always \\\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">heussd/fivefilters-full-text-rss:latest\n</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 data-sanitized-id=\"feed-reader\">Feed Reader</h3>\n<p>There are a couple different ways to pull in these RSS feeds.

Here is poll I ran on Twitter.</p>\n<blockquote data-sanitized-class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Do you use RSS?</p>— Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christitustech/status/1589727064957284352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 7, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"how-we-used-to-browse-the-internet\">How we used to browse the Internet</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/why-we-dont-browse-the-internet-anymore/altavista.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The era of altavista, dogpile, askjeeves, yahoo, excite, lycos, and others was an era of innovation and competition. There was a heated rivalry between Internet Exploader and Netscape, which Microsoft inevitably won with dirty business practices. That era was a time of discovery and businesses were figuring out how to make money on the internet.</p>\n<p>Information was scattered everywhere and the web was decentralized among hundreds of companies. When we “logged on” you made decisions on what to do. Sometimes you wanted to play a game, or stumble upon a new website, or browse a news group. Almost nothing curated and uniform. This is often referred to as Web 1.0.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"how-we-use-the-internet-today\">How we use the Internet today</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/why-we-dont-browse-the-internet-anymore/google.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We google anything we want, use our chromium browsers, and social media for everything else. Between Google, Facebook (I’m not calling it Meta), and Amazon we have everything. Facebook is dying off and for old people raging about some political garbage, Amazon we order anything want to appear on our doorstep, and Google is what powers almost every search we do.</p>\n<p>When we find the site we are looking for, it ends up with tons of ads or paywalled. Even worse, some reputable sites sell “sponsored posts” where the advertising gets posted directly in the feed. Imagine watching a television show and then in the third episode its nothing but a giant Subway ad. This is our modern internet.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"how-to-fix-it-with-rss\">How to fix it with RSS</h2>\n<p>Really Simple Syndication or RSS for short, is used to get updates from websites whenever something is posted. You have a listing of the entire website and you can pick the article you want to read. Even better you can subscribe to YouTube Channels and other social feeds to RSS as well.</p>\n<p>The problem? Ads, Brief Summaries, and redirects. We fix this by using a feed aggregator and never leave our RSS reader.</p>\n<p>The other problem with RSS Readers online are expensive using feedly($8), inoreader($10), and newsblur($3) per month. This used all be free with Google Reader, but in typical Google fashion they killed Reader.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"feed-aggregation\">Feed Aggregation</h3>\n<p>I use docker self-hosted aggregator <a href=\"https://github.com/heussd/fivefilters-full-text-rss-docker\">https://github.com/heussd/fivefilters-full-text-rss-docker</a> or if you want to pay money you can use <a href=\"http://ftr.fivefilters.org/\">five filters aggregator</a></p>\n<p>Here is my docker command to install and configure it on my docker server using port 50000</p>\n<div data-sanitized-class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-sanitized-class=\"chroma\"><code data-lang=\"fallback\" data-sanitized-class=\"language-fallback\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">docker run -d \\\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">--name=full-test-rss \\\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">-p 50000:80 \\\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">--restart always \\\n</span></span><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">heussd/fivefilters-full-text-rss:latest\n</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 data-sanitized-id=\"feed-reader\">Feed Reader</h3>\n<p>There are a couple different ways to pull in these RSS feeds.

Let’s configure it from a noobs perspective and show you it’s power.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"why-vim\">Why VIM?</h2>\n<p>There is so many things to learn about VIM, but before we start the question often pops up why not just use VS Code or IntelliJ?</p>\n<p>VS Code and IntelliJ have some fantastic ease of use, and great debugging capabilities. There is extension support to add some amazing functionality. So why do many programmers still use VIM? one word: SPEED!</p>\n<p>There is nothing that can even compare when it comes to speed from a veteran VIM user. They will blaze through code at the speed of light and change so much on their screen that you will have a hard time following just watching it. Don’t believe me? Just watch ANY “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen/videos\">The Primeagen</a>” videos</p>\n<p>So if it’s so fast why don’t most people use VIM? It’s hard and has one of the biggest learning curves that I have ever seen from any program. It will take <strong>YEARS</strong> to master, months to be better than vs code/intellij editors, and weeks of learning to be comparable to any other editor on the market.</p>\n<p>However, the payoff is beyond worth it to me. The reward feels so good when you start to <em>get</em> it. The big thing… you can throw your mouse away, because when you get it… a mouse is no longer needed.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"beginning-steps\">Beginning steps</h2>\n<p>The very first thing you need to know about vim is the modes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Normal Mode - The default mode you enter into on launch. This allows quick movement, exiting, commands, but you don’t “type” in this mode.</li>\n<li>Insert Mode - Pressing <code>i</code> on your keyboard will allow you enter insert mode. This allows you to type text and keyboard input to the open file.</li>\n<li>Visual Mode - Pressing <code>v</code> on your keyboard will put you in visual mode. This allows you to highlight and use commands on highlighted syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: You can escape Insert and Visual mode to go back to Normal mode with <code>esc</code> key</em></p>\n<p>The other MEME you will always see about vim is you can’t exit it… just turn your computer off. Haha, but seriously exiting vim is probably my favorite thing and that brings us to the first thing to remember:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If something is slow in vim, there is a way to do it faster in vim”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The official way to save and quit vim is to press the following in normal mode: <code>:wq</code> or faster <code>:x</code> or even faster <code>ZZ</code></p>\n<p>To quit without saving: <code>:q!</code> or faster <code>ZQ</code></p>\n<p>VIM Cheatsheets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devhints.io/vim\">https://devhints.io/vim</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vim.rtorr.com/\">https://vim.rtorr.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote data-sanitized-class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Created a cheatsheet to sit on my background.<br>Handy if you are starting to learn vim. <a href=\"https://t.co/dM6cl3ebho\">pic.twitter.com/dM6cl3ebho</a></p>— Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christitustech/status/1577690702200590336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"learning-the-basics\">Learning the basics</h2>\n<p>Now that you can actually function inside of vim, you might be thinking… “How in the hell do elite programmers use this damn program so fast?”.</p>\n<p>Movement and muscle memory are the biggest things with vim. It’s not just knowing the keys, but using them without thinking. This may seem impossible, but the more you practice the better you will get.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of <code>vimtutor</code> which walks you through the basics of vim. However, I’d encourage you to treat it like speed runners of your favorite video game. Run <code>vimtutor</code> as often as you can and treat it like a video game. How fast can you run it? Can you beat the old time? Can you complete the entire thing for the first time?!</p>\n<p>This is where you will pick up the speed. Between the constant cheatsheets and running <code>vimtutor</code> as often as possible.</p>\n<p>Other tips are moving as much of your workflow into vim as possible and customizing it to <strong>YOUR</strong> needs. Don’t just copy and paste some vimrc file your favorite programmer uses… it’s made for that person NOT YOU!</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"making-vim-your-own\">Making VIM your own</h2>\n<p>It is time to elevate your game to the elite status and making your own <code>.vimrc</code> file. This is where you make it feel awesome, even if you still suck at using vim. It’s important that you make vim feel good as this will make you want to continue using it.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using VIM for a month and this is my <code>.vimrc</code> file. I use a lot of plugins, themes, and just a few hotkeys. This isn’t what an experts .vimrc file looks like, as I still consider myself just now leaving the beginner stages into an intermediate user. As time goes on I will expand this file by adding more shortcuts and better hotkeys.</p>\n<p>Source: <a

src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P88ydZVcm1s\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"></iframe>\n</div>","content":"<p>VIM editor is one of the most beloved, but often misunderstood editors in existence. Let’s configure it from a noobs perspective and show you it’s power.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"why-vim\">Why VIM?</h2>\n<p>There is so many things to learn about VIM, but before we start the question often pops up why not just use VS Code or IntelliJ?</p>\n<p>VS Code and IntelliJ have some fantastic ease of use, and great debugging capabilities. There is extension support to add some amazing functionality. So why do many programmers still use VIM? one word: SPEED!</p>\n<p>There is nothing that can even compare when it comes to speed from a veteran VIM user. They will blaze through code at the speed of light and change so much on their screen that you will have a hard time following just watching it. Don’t believe me? Just watch ANY “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen/videos\">The Primeagen</a>” videos</p>\n<p>So if it’s so fast why don’t most people use VIM? It’s hard and has one of the biggest learning curves that I have ever seen from any program. It will take <strong>YEARS</strong> to master, months to be better than vs code/intellij editors, and weeks of learning to be comparable to any other editor on the market.</p>\n<p>However, the payoff is beyond worth it to me. The reward feels so good when you start to <em>get</em> it. The big thing… you can throw your mouse away, because when you get it… a mouse is no longer needed.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"beginning-steps\">Beginning steps</h2>\n<p>The very first thing you need to know about vim is the modes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Normal Mode - The default mode you enter into on launch. This allows quick movement, exiting, commands, but you don’t “type” in this mode.</li>\n<li>Insert Mode - Pressing <code>i</code> on your keyboard will allow you enter insert mode. This allows you to type text and keyboard input to the open file.</li>\n<li>Visual Mode - Pressing <code>v</code> on your keyboard will put you in visual mode. This allows you to highlight and use commands on highlighted syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: You can escape Insert and Visual mode to go back to Normal mode with <code>esc</code> key</em></p>\n<p>The other MEME you will always see about vim is you can’t exit it… just turn your computer off. Haha, but seriously exiting vim is probably my favorite thing and that brings us to the first thing to remember:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If something is slow in vim, there is a way to do it faster in vim”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The official way to save and quit vim is to press the following in normal mode: <code>:wq</code> or faster <code>:x</code> or even faster <code>ZZ</code></p>\n<p>To quit without saving: <code>:q!</code> or faster <code>ZQ</code></p>\n<p>VIM Cheatsheets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devhints.io/vim\">https://devhints.io/vim</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vim.rtorr.com/\">https://vim.rtorr.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote data-sanitized-class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Created a cheatsheet to sit on my background.<br>Handy if you are starting to learn vim. <a href=\"https://t.co/dM6cl3ebho\">pic.twitter.com/dM6cl3ebho</a></p>— Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christitustech/status/1577690702200590336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"learning-the-basics\">Learning the basics</h2>\n<p>Now that you can actually function inside of vim, you might be thinking… “How in the hell do elite programmers use this damn program so fast?”.</p>\n<p>Movement and muscle memory are the biggest things with vim. It’s not just knowing the keys, but using them without thinking. This may seem impossible, but the more you practice the better you will get.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of <code>vimtutor</code> which walks you through the basics of vim. However, I’d encourage you to treat it like speed runners of your favorite video game. Run <code>vimtutor</code> as often as you can and treat it like a video game. How fast can you run it? Can you beat the old time? Can you complete the entire thing for the first time?!</p>\n<p>This is where you will pick up the speed. Between the constant cheatsheets and running <code>vimtutor</code> as often as possible.</p>\n<p>Other tips are moving as much of your workflow into vim as possible and customizing it to <strong>YOUR</strong> needs. Don’t just copy and paste some vimrc file your favorite programmer uses… it’s made for that person NOT YOU!</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"making-vim-your-own\">Making VIM your own</h2>\n<p>It is time to elevate your game to the elite status and making your own <code>.vimrc</code> file. This is where you make it feel awesome, even if you still suck at using vim. It’s important that you make vim feel good as this will make you want to continue using it.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using VIM for a month and this is my <code>.vimrc</code> file. I use a lot of plugins, themes, and just a few hotkeys. This isn’t what an experts .vimrc file looks like, as I still consider myself just now leaving the beginner stages into an intermediate user. As time goes on I will expand this file by adding more shortcuts and better hotkeys.</p>\n<p>Source: <a

Here are the big ones I hate.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Taskbar - It is just plain awful as it is based on a new UWP platform that isn’t nearly as good as 10’s taskbar. Also you can’t move it to the left, right, or top like you can in 10.</li>\n<li>Context Menu - The new look might look cleaner, but is far less functional. I’m working on a tweak to revert this back to the windows 10 menu</li>\n<li>Changing Default Apps is awful in Windows 11. Everything is extension based now, where it is program based in Windows 10.</li>\n<li>Windows 10 still has support until 2025, so don’t be in a rush to switch.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"walkthrough-video\">Walkthrough Video</h2>\n\n<div>\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBrh-9BdGVQ\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"></iframe>\n</div>","category":"","link":"https://christitus.com/win10-to-win11/","creator":"","pubDate":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 20:00:00 -0400","enclosure":"","enclosureType":"","image":"","id":"","language":"","folder":"Windows","feed":"Windows","read":false,"favorite":false,"created":false,"tags":[],"hash":"d0bd629a43c686d144eed4ef53eb3518","highlights":[]},{"title":"Is Windows Bad","description":"<p>It’s what we know.

I designed a vbs script to migrate on-premises outlook mailboxes to O365 mailboxes so a thousand users wouldn’t have to redownload all their emails. However this can easily be abused for those malicious actors out there. Be cautious of this loophole and any vbs script that runs on your system.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"group-policy\">Group Policy</h3>\n<p>Again this is used in many pro+ systems and even if you aren’t part of a domain can be abused by using <code>gpedit.msc</code> to create a local policy that can run scripts, lock user features, and much more.

I have expanded it to install the programs you select, which is a bigger selection than ninite. The classic debloat is there, but also includes a tweaks section with quality of life features. To round out everything, I have included my recommended settings for Windows update that I use in a variety of businesses.

As of the writing of this article there is 4 main parts: install, debloat, features and old panels, and windows updates. Let me breakdown what each part does and what you should use.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"install\">Install</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/winutil/screen-install.png\" alt=\"install\"></p>\n<p>The install is basically a better version of ninite that many people use. It leverages Microsoft’s winget utility to not only install tons of software that you select with a check-mark, but also gives you the ability to upgrade all the software quickly. By using this utility you will save hours on the install, but also make it very easy to keep all your programs up to date.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"debloat\">Debloat</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/winutil/screen-debloat.png\" alt=\"debloat\"></p>\n<p>Debloating windows is always a moving target and there are many utilities out there. Many of them are too heavy handed in my opinion. This takes a more minimal approach that should not damage your Windows install. At the top there are three buttons Desktop, Laptop, and Minimal. These are curated selections based on my recommendations</p>\n<p><strong>Desktop</strong> - This is for Desktops <em>DUH</em>, but it will disable features like power throttling and many services will be set to not auto start. This will give your desktop the best performance without any downside.</p>\n<p><strong>Laptop</strong> - This one is just like desktop but doesn’t mess with power settings as we don’t want to kill our laptops battery.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimal</strong> - This one will just do the absolute basic privacy / security settings. Very minor optimizations will also be made.</p>\n<p>I must warn you to NOT use all the settings at once, or simple remove everything from the MS Store.

I have expanded it to install the programs you select, which is a bigger selection than ninite. The classic debloat is there, but also includes a tweaks section with quality of life features. To round out everything, I have included my recommended settings for Windows update that I use in a variety of businesses. Misuse of this utility can break your install so please be careful and I do not provide any help or assistance should this happen!</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"one-command---download-and-usage\">One Command - Download and Usage</h2>\n<p>From an Elevated (Run as Administrator) PowerShell prompt</p>\n<div data-sanitized-class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-sanitized-class=\"chroma\"><code data-lang=\"fallback\" data-sanitized-class=\"language-fallback\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"line\"><span data-sanitized-class=\"cl\">iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex\n</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 data-sanitized-id=\"parts-of-utility\">Parts of Utility</h2>\n<p>There are four main parts of this utility but I can expand this to an infinite number of tabs if expansion is needed and will probably happen in the future. As of the writing of this article there is 4 main parts: install, debloat, features and old panels, and windows updates. Let me breakdown what each part does and what you should use.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"install\">Install</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/winutil/screen-install.png\" alt=\"install\"></p>\n<p>The install is basically a better version of ninite that many people use. It leverages Microsoft’s winget utility to not only install tons of software that you select with a check-mark, but also gives you the ability to upgrade all the software quickly. By using this utility you will save hours on the install, but also make it very easy to keep all your programs up to date.</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"debloat\">Debloat</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/winutil/screen-debloat.png\" alt=\"debloat\"></p>\n<p>Debloating windows is always a moving target and there are many utilities out there. Many of them are too heavy handed in my opinion. This takes a more minimal approach that should not damage your Windows install. At the top there are three buttons Desktop, Laptop, and Minimal. These are curated selections based on my recommendations</p>\n<p><strong>Desktop</strong> - This is for Desktops <em>DUH</em>, but it will disable features like power throttling and many services will be set to not auto start. This will give your desktop the best performance without any downside.</p>\n<p><strong>Laptop</strong> - This one is just like desktop but doesn’t mess with power settings as we don’t want to kill our laptops battery.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimal</strong> - This one will just do the absolute basic privacy / security settings. Very minor optimizations will also be made.</p>\n<p>I must warn you to NOT use all the settings at once, or simple remove everything from the MS Store. Many times this will debloat the install but will BREAK the MS Store or uninstall any games / apps that were installed using it. This is why this option is never selected, but I left it there for those that really want to remove it. I personally do NOT recommend this, but I understand those that want to remove it</p>\n<p>Note: This part of the utility can break an install if used carelessly, but it does make a restore point so if you have a lot problems with it, you can use System Restore to rollback the changes or the Undo All option.

They are wildly volatile speculative assets that’s valuation will swing wildly from one moment to the next. However, This article isn’t about how much its worth or how much it will be worth. This is about it’s practical application and how it will change the world we live in. Just by having this knowledge you will be able to profit and be ready for that future.</p>\n<p>Practical application of crypto is all over our society today. Many banks are using it, and wealthy individuals are utilizing it. Here are the ways it is used today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>International Bank transfers (Ripple) - Long wire delays and intermediary banking is becoming a relic of the past. Banks can leverage it to make trustless transfers between banks in seconds around the world.</li>\n<li>International Money Transfers (Bitcoin) - Want to send money to a relative in a different nation? Well using Bitcoin is probably the easiest way to get this done with almost no fees. You could send $1000 for less than $1 fee.</li>\n<li>Banking Replacement (Yield Farming) - Some companies are providing loans and holding crypto while passing along a profits to those holding crypto with them. Think of a savings account on steroids or collateral loans.</li>\n<li>Synthetic Assets (Synthetix) - What to trade Apple stock, gold, or other assets that exist? Sythetic assets are tracked using the blockchain and traded either for the said asset or for the dollar amount the asset is worth.</li>\n<li>Send Private Transactions (Monero) - Send money between two entities completely that is completely private. <em>Please note: Bitcoin and other projects are actively tracked, while some are still privacy oriented, much like physical cash.</em></li>\n<li>Insurance, Data Backup, and all kinds of data that you will always want a ledger of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/wallet.png\" alt=\"wallet\"></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"how-to-store-crypto\">How to Store Crypto</h2>\n<p>There are two ways of thinking about storing crypto. You can either hold it all yourself or you can use a custodian where you rely on a company to hold it for you, much like a bank. Let’s address both ways:</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"storing-crypto-in-your-wallet\">Storing Crypto in Your Wallet</h3>\n<p>There are digital wallets where you can safely store your crypto and access it. They come in two types with different pros and cons.</p>\n<h4 data-sanitized-id=\"hot-wallets\">Hot Wallets</h4>\n<p>Hot wallets refer to software that runs on your computer with a password that protects the crypto.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convenient</li>\n<li>Quick Access</li>\n<li>Fast exchanges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security: Computer compromised or Private key theft</li>\n<li>Backups: If you lose your password or misplace your keys/seed… there is no recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recommended Wallets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Desktop &amp; Mobile) Exodus <a href=\"https://www.exodus.io/\">https://www.exodus.io</a>\n<img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/exodus.png\" alt=\"exodus\"></li>\n<li>Other advanced wallets I’d recommend come from the official projects or opensource on github.com</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 data-sanitized-id=\"cold-wallets\">Cold Wallets</h4>\n<p>Cold wallets refer to hardware that hides the keys so the computer never sees them, but you authorize transactions on the device itself.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure</li>\n<li>Transfers take place on isolated device</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not as Quick</li>\n<li>If you misplace your device, you can only recover things through a seed (phrase written on paper)</li>\n<li>Backups: If you misplace both the seed and device… everything is gone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recommended Wallets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/ledger.png\" alt=\"ledger\"> Ledger <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">https://www.ledger.com</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/trezor.png\" alt=\"trezor\"> Trezor <a href=\"https://trezor.io/\">https://trezor.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"storing-crypto-with-a-custodian\">Storing Crypto with a Custodian</h3>\n<p>These are companies that you are sending your money to for safe keeping, much like a bank. They can be insured, but none of them are federally insured like a traditional bank account. I lump these companies into three categories, on and off ramps, exchanges, and yield farmers. Here are my take and recommendations on each of these. <em>Note: I like to use companies in my local country for regulatory reasons and safety</em></p>\n<h4 data-sanitized-id=\"on-and-off-ramp-companies\">On and Off Ramp Companies</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/coinbase.jpg\" alt=\"coinbase\"></p>\n<p>Companies like Coinbase or Gemini are the two I use often. These companies are based in the United States and you can link your bank account to them to transfer Crypto to Dollar directly into your checking account. The fees are high and they should only be used for the purpose. While they do offer other services, it will be at a premium. <em>Please Note: DO NOT use credit cards to purchase crypto!

They are wildly volatile speculative assets that’s valuation will swing wildly from one moment to the next. However, This article isn’t about how much its worth or how much it will be worth. This is about it’s practical application and how it will change the world we live in. Just by having this knowledge you will be able to profit and be ready for that future.</p>\n<p>Practical application of crypto is all over our society today. Many banks are using it, and wealthy individuals are utilizing it. Here are the ways it is used today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>International Bank transfers (Ripple) - Long wire delays and intermediary banking is becoming a relic of the past. Banks can leverage it to make trustless transfers between banks in seconds around the world.</li>\n<li>International Money Transfers (Bitcoin) - Want to send money to a relative in a different nation? Well using Bitcoin is probably the easiest way to get this done with almost no fees. You could send $1000 for less than $1 fee.</li>\n<li>Banking Replacement (Yield Farming) - Some companies are providing loans and holding crypto while passing along a profits to those holding crypto with them. Think of a savings account on steroids or collateral loans.</li>\n<li>Synthetic Assets (Synthetix) - What to trade Apple stock, gold, or other assets that exist? Sythetic assets are tracked using the blockchain and traded either for the said asset or for the dollar amount the asset is worth.</li>\n<li>Send Private Transactions (Monero) - Send money between two entities completely that is completely private. <em>Please note: Bitcoin and other projects are actively tracked, while some are still privacy oriented, much like physical cash.</em></li>\n<li>Insurance, Data Backup, and all kinds of data that you will always want a ledger of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/wallet.png\" alt=\"wallet\"></p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"how-to-store-crypto\">How to Store Crypto</h2>\n<p>There are two ways of thinking about storing crypto. You can either hold it all yourself or you can use a custodian where you rely on a company to hold it for you, much like a bank. Let’s address both ways:</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"storing-crypto-in-your-wallet\">Storing Crypto in Your Wallet</h3>\n<p>There are digital wallets where you can safely store your crypto and access it. They come in two types with different pros and cons.</p>\n<h4 data-sanitized-id=\"hot-wallets\">Hot Wallets</h4>\n<p>Hot wallets refer to software that runs on your computer with a password that protects the crypto.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convenient</li>\n<li>Quick Access</li>\n<li>Fast exchanges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security: Computer compromised or Private key theft</li>\n<li>Backups: If you lose your password or misplace your keys/seed… there is no recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recommended Wallets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Desktop &amp; Mobile) Exodus <a href=\"https://www.exodus.io/\">https://www.exodus.io</a>\n<img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/exodus.png\" alt=\"exodus\"></li>\n<li>Other advanced wallets I’d recommend come from the official projects or opensource on github.com</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 data-sanitized-id=\"cold-wallets\">Cold Wallets</h4>\n<p>Cold wallets refer to hardware that hides the keys so the computer never sees them, but you authorize transactions on the device itself.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure</li>\n<li>Transfers take place on isolated device</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not as Quick</li>\n<li>If you misplace your device, you can only recover things through a seed (phrase written on paper)</li>\n<li>Backups: If you misplace both the seed and device… everything is gone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recommended Wallets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/ledger.png\" alt=\"ledger\"> Ledger <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">https://www.ledger.com</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/trezor.png\" alt=\"trezor\"> Trezor <a href=\"https://trezor.io/\">https://trezor.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"storing-crypto-with-a-custodian\">Storing Crypto with a Custodian</h3>\n<p>These are companies that you are sending your money to for safe keeping, much like a bank. They can be insured, but none of them are federally insured like a traditional bank account. I lump these companies into three categories, on and off ramps, exchanges, and yield farmers. Here are my take and recommendations on each of these. <em>Note: I like to use companies in my local country for regulatory reasons and safety</em></p>\n<h4 data-sanitized-id=\"on-and-off-ramp-companies\">On and Off Ramp Companies</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/crypto/coinbase.jpg\" alt=\"coinbase\"></p>\n<p>Companies like Coinbase or Gemini are the two I use often. These companies are based in the United States and you can link your bank account to them to transfer Crypto to Dollar directly into your checking account. The fees are high and they should only be used for the purpose. While they do offer other services, it will be at a premium. <em>Please Note: DO NOT use credit cards to purchase crypto! You will have exorbitant fees and it is NOT worth it!</em><br>\nI don’t recommend storing money here, but they do have a good track record.

Internet","description":"<p>Renewing website domains, paying for web hosting, and having them expire are all going to be a thing of the past. \nUsing IPFS (Inter-planetary File System) is a way to store websites decentralized and without any money. How fast or how slow it will be, is determined by how popular it is with IPFS nodes. \nThis guide shows how to host a website, owning a web domain forever, and redirecting these domains to traditional website hosts.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"ipfs---a-better-storage-system\">IPFS - A Better Storage System</h2>\n<p>IPFS is absolutely amazing as you can run a node on anything and share your files. If they are used by other people then they will populate to their nodes and I’ve shared and used video files over 1 GB in size! The main issue is there isn’t many browsers that support IPFS and it is slower than normal storage right now. However, you never have to worry about hosting costs and as long as the content is accessed by others on a regular basis it will live forever!</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"improving-ipfs-in-brave-browser\">Improving IPFS in Brave Browser</h3>\n<p>I highly recommend using IPFS Companion if you plan on doing this regularly. You don’t have to run your own node, but can that is up to you. Using this add-on will help resolve IPFS addresses much faster even in Gateway only mode.</p>\n<p>Enable IPFS Companion Extension</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/\">https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After installing IPFS Companion change the following brave settings under Settings -&gt; IPFS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable IPFS Public Gateway Fallback (Not Required, but recommended)</li>\n<li>Enable IPFS Companion \n<img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/future-internet/ipfs-settings.png\" alt=\"ipfs-settings\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enable Blockchain domains - The Unstoppable Domains extension (In the future, this should be baked into many browsers. Brave natively supports .crypto)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension\">https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"blockchains---not-all-created-equal\">Blockchains - Not all created equal</h2>\n<p>The technology powering blockchains are amazing, but most just care about the monetary gain. I’m more interested in actually using the blockchain and where all the meta data lives for decentralized web or Web3. So what blockchains have I used for this? Lets review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum was one of the original ones that is incredible slow and expensive. I feel like this has turned from a usable blockchain into something only millionaires can use. Maybe this will change in the future, but right now it isn’t usable because of the cost to submit transactions. ENS Domains uses ethereum.</li>\n<li>Polygon is a bridge blockchain that drastically improves upon what ethereum started. Fees are non-existent and is very functional. Transfer times are generally about a minute. This is currently what unstoppable domains uses.</li>\n<li>Solana is not something I recommend, but is considered the fastest blockchain out there. However, It has crashed multiple times and halted completely. I am also skeptical that is even decentralized with the problems it has had. It is very easy to work on and something to watch.</li>\n<li>Cardano is probably my favorite out of all these blockchains for the future. It is very decentralized, transactions can be as fast as 20 seconds and up to a couple minutes. Its roadmap is probably the most promising blockchain with future transactions hitting upwards of 10,000+ transactions per second in a decentralized format. Another possible chain that can be used in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"buying-websites-forever\">Buying Websites Forever</h2>\n<p>Currently ens domains requires renewing websites, while unstoppable domains provides them forever. This entire space is exploding, so getting a good name is becoming more and more difficult just like the traditional web. There is a very healthy resale market on Opensea.io that folks are using to squat or resell domains purchased through unstoppable domains. If adoption keeps moving this direction, we will soon see some pretty ridiculous prices on domain names.

How fast or how slow it will be, is determined by how popular it is with IPFS nodes. \nThis guide shows how to host a website, owning a web domain forever, and redirecting these domains to traditional website hosts.</p>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"ipfs---a-better-storage-system\">IPFS - A Better Storage System</h2>\n<p>IPFS is absolutely amazing as you can run a node on anything and share your files. If they are used by other people then they will populate to their nodes and I’ve shared and used video files over 1 GB in size! The main issue is there isn’t many browsers that support IPFS and it is slower than normal storage right now. However, you never have to worry about hosting costs and as long as the content is accessed by others on a regular basis it will live forever!</p>\n<h3 data-sanitized-id=\"improving-ipfs-in-brave-browser\">Improving IPFS in Brave Browser</h3>\n<p>I highly recommend using IPFS Companion if you plan on doing this regularly. You don’t have to run your own node, but can that is up to you. Using this add-on will help resolve IPFS addresses much faster even in Gateway only mode.</p>\n<p>Enable IPFS Companion Extension</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/\">https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After installing IPFS Companion change the following brave settings under Settings -&gt; IPFS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable IPFS Public Gateway Fallback (Not Required, but recommended)</li>\n<li>Enable IPFS Companion \n<img src=\"https://christitus.com/images/2022/future-internet/ipfs-settings.png\" alt=\"ipfs-settings\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enable Blockchain domains - The Unstoppable Domains extension (In the future, this should be baked into many browsers. Brave natively supports .crypto)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension\">https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"blockchains---not-all-created-equal\">Blockchains - Not all created equal</h2>\n<p>The technology powering blockchains are amazing, but most just care about the monetary gain. I’m more interested in actually using the blockchain and where all the meta data lives for decentralized web or Web3. So what blockchains have I used for this? Lets review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum was one of the original ones that is incredible slow and expensive. I feel like this has turned from a usable blockchain into something only millionaires can use. Maybe this will change in the future, but right now it isn’t usable because of the cost to submit transactions. ENS Domains uses ethereum.</li>\n<li>Polygon is a bridge blockchain that drastically improves upon what ethereum started. Fees are non-existent and is very functional. Transfer times are generally about a minute. This is currently what unstoppable domains uses.</li>\n<li>Solana is not something I recommend, but is considered the fastest blockchain out there. However, It has crashed multiple times and halted completely. I am also skeptical that is even decentralized with the problems it has had. It is very easy to work on and something to watch.</li>\n<li>Cardano is probably my favorite out of all these blockchains for the future. It is very decentralized, transactions can be as fast as 20 seconds and up to a couple minutes. Its roadmap is probably the most promising blockchain with future transactions hitting upwards of 10,000+ transactions per second in a decentralized format. Another possible chain that can be used in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sanitized-id=\"buying-websites-forever\">Buying Websites Forever</h2>\n<p>Currently ens domains requires renewing websites, while unstoppable domains provides them forever. This entire space is exploding, so getting a good name is becoming more and more difficult just like the traditional web. There is a very healthy resale market on Opensea.io that folks are using to squat or resell domains purchased through unstoppable domains. If adoption keeps moving this direction, we will soon see some pretty ridiculous prices on domain names.

Taking any action to access someone's account without consent is illegal. Never replicate these steps on any accounts which you do not own. The redacted screen captures are shared here with consent of the client with hopes that they help others avoid becoming a victim of this type of attack.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Recently, a client conducted a full privacy reboot including a new home titled to an anonymous entity. This client had read the books and had already established most of the digital strategies. While within a transition from his old life to his new anonymous life, he went on vacation and asked us to dig in deep. He wanted to know anywhere he may still be vulnerable <em>before</em> he gets to his anonymous home. With written consent to access anything attached to him, we attacked. We share the results with encouragement from the client to spread awareness.</p>\n<p>I started with breach data, as it is always the most fruitful. I confirmed that all of his exposed passwords had already been changed and I could not access any of his breached accounts. However, I noticed something interesting. In a very recent data breach, a telephone number which I had not seen during his initial assessment was associated to one of his newer email accounts. This breach was associated with an online vendor which he had used to purchase an item. The address was his PMB and his password was properly hashed and salted. However, the new number was a big lead.</p>\n<p>I searched this number through various caller ID services and confirmed it had been ported often. This immediately made me suspect it was associated with a temporary number service or VoIP provider. A buried Google search finally gave me the answer.

This client had read the books and had already established most of the digital strategies.

I confirmed that all of his exposed passwords had already been changed and I could not access any of his breached accounts. However, I noticed something interesting. In a very recent data breach, a telephone number which I had not seen during his initial assessment was associated to one of his newer email accounts. This breach was associated with an online vendor which he had used to purchase an item. The address was his PMB and his password was properly hashed and salted. However, the new number was a big lead.</p>\n<p>I searched this number through various caller ID services and confirmed it had been ported often.

The following steps allow you to remove your email address and exposed credentials from these services.</p>\n<p>Have I Been Pwned</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct a search of your email address or username at <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/OptOut\">https://haveibeenpwned.com/OptOut</a>.</li>\n<li>Click the link in the email confirmation.</li>\n<li>Choose the \"Remove email address completely\" option.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dehashed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a free burner account at <a href=\"https://dehashed.com/\">https://dehashed.com</a>.</li>\n<li>Conduct a search of your email address or username.</li>\n<li>Click \"Request entry removal\" link below each result.</li>\n<li>Click the confirmation link within each email.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spycloud</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to the IntelTechniques Breach Tool at <a href=\"https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Breaches.html\">https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Breaches.html</a>.</li>\n<li>Search your email address at the first \"Spycloud\" option.</li>\n<li>If any results are present, navigate to <a href=\"https://spycloud.com/contact-us\">https://spycloud.com/contact-us</a>.</li>\n<li>Complete the from requesting removal of your records.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Leakcheck</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Register for a free burner account at <a href=\"https://leakcheck.net/\">https://leakcheck.net</a>.</li>\n<li>Conduct a search of your email address.</li>\n<li>If entries are present , send an email from the exposed address with a written removal request to removal@leakcheck.net.</li>\n<li>Click the link within the confirmation email.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PSBDMP</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to the IntelTechniques Breach Tool at <a href=\"https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Breaches.html\">https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Breaches.html</a>.</li>\n<li>Search your email address at the first \"PSBDMP\" option.</li>\n<li>If any results are present, send an email to admin@psbdmp.ws requesting removal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IntelX</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct a search of your email address at <a href=\"https://intelx.io/\">https://intelx.io</a>.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <a href=\"https://intelx.io/abuse\">https://intelx.io/abuse</a>.</li>\n<li>Paste any URLs associated with the found content \"Full Data\" links.</li>\n<li>Submit request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HudsonRock</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to the IntelTechniques Breach Tool at <a href=\"https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Breaches.html\">https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Breaches.html</a>.</li>\n<li>Search your email address at the first \"HudsonRock\" option.</li>\n<li>If any results are present, send an email to hello@hudsonrock.com requesting removal.

However, it will remove them from the most commonly used lookup services. As always, change any exposed credentials immediately within your password manager and the services impacted.</p>","category":"OSINT","link":"https://inteltechniques.com/blog/2022/08/05/credential-exposure-removal-guide/","creator":"michaelbazzell","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Aug 2022 10:05:00 -0400","enclosure":"","enclosureType":"","image":"","id":"","language":"","folder":"Privacy, Security & OSINT","feed":"Privacy, Security & OSINT","read":false,"favorite":false,"created":false,"tags":[],"hash":"fa777fcbd44443b99d24019afbc62169","highlights":[]},{"title":"The Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show – Episode 272","description":"<p><strong>EPISODE 272-Processor Attacks Explained<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>This week Paul Asadoorian joins me to explain vulnerabilities within our computer processors and current solutions.</p>\n<p>Direct support for this podcast comes from our privacy services, online training, and new books for 2022: <a href=\"https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html\">Extreme Privacy (4th Edition)</a> and  <a href=\"https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html\">Open Source Intelligence Techniques (9th Edition)</a>.
