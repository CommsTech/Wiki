## Cloudflare Tunnel client

Contains the command-line client for Cloudflare Tunnel, a tunneling daemon that proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to your origins. This daemon sits between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a webserver). Cloudflare attracts client requests and sends them to you via this daemon, without requiring you to poke holes on your firewall --- your origin can remain as closed as possible. Extensive documentation can be found in the [Cloudflare Tunnel section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps) of the Cloudflare Docs. All usages related with proxying to your origins are available under `cloudflared tunnel help`.

You can also use `cloudflared` to access Tunnel origins (that are protected with `cloudflared tunnel`) for TCP traffic at Layer 4 (i.e., not HTTP/websocket), which is relevant for use cases such as SSH, RDP, etc. Such usages are available under `cloudflared access help`.

You can instead use [WARP client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/private-networks) to access private origins behind Tunnels for Layer 4 traffic without requiring `cloudflared access` commands on the client side.
