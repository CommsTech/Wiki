## 1. Install uCareSystem Core using PPA

I tested this PPA on Ubuntu 16.04, however It might work on older Ubuntu versions, and Ubuntu derivatives such as Linux Mint.

uCareSystem Core developer have created a PPA to make the installation much easier for beginners.

To add the PPA, run:

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:utappia/stable

Update the sources list using command:

$ sudo apt-get update

Finally, install uCareSystem core using the following command:

$ sudo apt-get install ucaresystem-core
