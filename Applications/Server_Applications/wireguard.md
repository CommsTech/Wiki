## Troubleshooting

With this command you can enable the debug logging in WireGuard:

```bash
echo 'module wireguard +p' | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
```

And the same command with -p can disable it again:

```bash
echo 'module wireguard -p' | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
```
