# phpldapadmin

phpLDAPadmin is a web based LDAP data management tool for system administrators. It is commonly known and referred by many as "PLA".

PLA is designed to be compliant with LDAP RFCs, enabling it to be used with any LDAP server.

If you come across an LDAP server, where PLA exhibits problems, please open an issue with full details of the problem so that we can have it fixed.

For up to date information on PLA, please head to the [wiki](https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin/wiki).

> **NOTE**: GIT **master** is currently in active development, and as such functionality may be missing, broken or not working as expected.
>
> If you are after a working version of PLA, please use one of the tagged releases.

## Demo

If you haven't seen PLA in action, you can head here to the [demo](https://demo.phpldapadmin.org) site.

## Running the docker image

PLA v2 is available via docker for preview. (PLA v2 is still under heavy development.)

The container is the same one used for the demo site - but you'll be able to point it to your local LDAP server and see how things work.

Take a look at the [Docker Container](https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin/wiki/Docker-Container) page for more details.

> Please let me know if you have any troubles with the container image, eg: usage of the container itself, or usage when it is pointing to your LDAP server.
>
> Open an issue (details below) with enough information for me to be able to recreate the problem. An `LDIF` will be invaluable if it is not handling data correctly.

## Getting Help

The best place to get help with PLA (new and old) is on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/phpldapadmin/info).

## Found a bug?

If you have found a bug, and can provide detailed instructions so that it can be reproduced, please open an [issue](https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin/issues) and provide those details.

Before opening a ticket, please check to see if it hasn't already been reported, and if it has, please provide any additional information that will help it be fixed.

*TIP*: Issues opened with:

* details enabling the problem to be reproduced,

* including (if appropriate) an LDIF with the data that exhibits the problem,

* a patch (or a git pull request) to fix the problem

will be looked at first :)

## THANK YOU

Over the years, many, many, many people have supported PLA with either their time, their coding or with financial donations.

I have tried to send an email to acknowledge each contribution, and if you haven't seen anything personally from me, I am sorry, but please know that I do appreciate all the help I get, in whatever form it is provided.

Again, Thank You.
