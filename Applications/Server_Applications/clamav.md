> Clam AntiVirus (**clamav**) is a free software, cross-platform antimalware toolkit able to detect many types of malware, including viruses. It was developed for Unix and has third party versions available for AIX, BSD, HP-UX, Linux, macOS, OpenVMS, OSF (Tru64) and Solaris. As of version 0.97.5, ClamAV builds and runs on Microsoft Windows. Both ClamAV and its updates are made available free of charge. One of its main uses is on mail servers as a server-side email virus scanner.

> Sourcefire, developer of intrusion detection products and the owner of Snort, announced on 17 August 2007 that it had acquired the trademarks and copyrights to ClamAV from five key developers.  Upon joining Sourcefire, the ClamAV team joined the Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team (VRT).  In turn, Cisco acquired Sourcefire in 2013. The Sourcefire VRT became Cisco Talos, and ClamAV development remains there.
