## Server requirements

* A reasonably fast web server with Apache 2 (nginx, IIS also supported)

* PHP 5.4 (other backends also available)

* MySQL database to store test results (optional, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL and SQLite also supported)

* A fast! internet connection

## Installation

Assuming you have PHP installed, the installation steps are quite simple.

I set this up on a QNAP.

For this example, I am using a folder called **speedtest** in my web share area.

1. Choose one of the example-xxx.html files as your new index.html in your speedtest folder. I used: example-singleServer-full.html
2. Add: speedtest.js, speedtest_worker.js, and favicon.ico to your speedtest folder.
3. Download all of the backend folder into speedtest/backend.
4. Download all of the results folder into speedtest/results.
5. Be sure your permissions allow execute (755).
6. Visit YOURSITE/speedtest/index.html and voila!
