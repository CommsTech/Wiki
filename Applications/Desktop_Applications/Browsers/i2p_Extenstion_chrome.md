# xtension-based Configuration: I2PChrome.js(Experimental, additional configuration)

An experimental, partially-automated configuration process for Chrome is available. In order to configure it, create a new _Profile_ especially for your I2P browsing, separate from the default profile. Then install this [_Extension_](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/i2pchromejs/ikdjcmomgldfciocnpekfndklkfgglpe) in your newly-created profile. This profile is now configured to use I2P. Highly detailed instructions are available at the [homepage.](https://eyedeekay.github.io/I2P-Configuration-For-Chromium)

#### All Chrome Versions

Chromium-Based Browsers like Chrome have slightly different places for their proxy settings depending on variant and platform. These instructions may be slightly different in Brave or Iridium, for instance. From the _Main_ menu, navigate to the _Settings_, and search for the menu item. Clicking it will open the right settings for your platform.

On Windows, this button will launch you into the shared proxy settings used by [_Internet Explorer_](https://geti2p.net/en/download/2.0.0/clearnet/https/download.i2p2.no/i2pinstall_2.0.0_windows.exe/download#ie8), and you can configure it by following the Internet Explorer 8 guide.
