# Data Modeling with DAX - Overview

The decision makers in all the organizations have identified the need for analyzing the historical
data of their organization in specific, and of the industry in general. This is becoming crucial
day-by-day in the present competitive world, to meet the ever-changing business challenges.

Big Data and Business Intelligence have become the buzzwords in the business world. Data
sources have become huge and data formats have become variant. The need of the hour is to
have simple-to-use tools to handle the ever-flowing vast data in less time to gain insight and
make relevant decisions at the appropriate time.

Data analysts can no longer wait for the required data to be processed by the IT department.
They require a handy tool that enables them to quickly comprehend the required data and make it
available in a format that helps the decision makers take required action at the right time.

Microsoft Excel has a powerful tool called as Power Pivot that was available as an add-in in the
prior versions of Excel and is built-in feature in Excel 2016. The database of Power Pivot, called
the data model and the formula language that works on the data model, called DAX ( **D** ata
**A** nalysis **E** xpressions) enables an Excel user to perform tasks such as data modeling and analysis
in no time.

In this tutorial, you will learn data modeling and analysis using DAX, based on the Power Pivot
data model. A sample Profit and Analysis database is used for the illustrations throughout this
tutorial.

## Data Modeling and Analysis Concepts

The data that you obtain from different variety of sources, termed as raw data, needs processing
before you can utilize it for analysis purposes. You will learn about these in the chapter − Data
Modeling and Analysis Concepts.

## Data Modeling and Analysis with Excel Power Pivot

Since the tool that you will be mastering in this tutorial is Excel Power Pivot, you need to know
how the data modeling and analysis steps are carried out in Power Pivot. You will learn these at
a broader level in the chapter - Data Modeling and Analysis with Excel Power Pivot.

As you proceed with the subsequent chapters, you will learn about the different facets of Power
Pivot, DAX and DAX functions in data modeling and analysis.

By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to perform data modeling and analysis with DAX for
any context at hand.


# Data Modeling with DAX - Concepts

Business Intelligence (BI) is gaining importance in several fields and organizations. Decision
making and forecasting based on historical data have become crucial in the ever-growing
competitive world. There is huge amount of data available both internally and externally from
diversified sources for any type of data analysis.

However, the challenge is to extract the relevant data from the available big data as per the
current requirements, and to store it in a way that is amicable for projecting different insights
from the data. A data model thus obtained with the usage of key business terms is a valuable
communication tool. The data model also needs to provide a quick way of generating reports on
an as needed basis.

Data modeling for BI systems enables you to meet many of the data challenges.

## Prerequisites for a Data Model for BI

A data model for BI should meet the requirements of the business for which data analysis is
being done. Following are the minimum basics that any data model has to meet −

### The data model needs to be Business Specific

A data model that is suitable for one line of business might not be suitable for a different line of
business. Hence, the data model must be developed based on the specific business, the business
terms used, the data types, and their relationships. It should be based on the objectives and the
type of decisions made in the organization.

### The data model needs to have built-in Intelligence

The data model should include built-in intelligence through metadata, hierarchies, and
inheritances that facilitate efficient and effective Business Intelligence process. With this, you
will be able to provide a common platform for different users, eliminating repetition of the
process.

### The data model needs to be Robust

The data model should precisely present the data specific to the business. It should enable
effective disk and memory storage so as to facilitate quick processing and reporting.

### The data model needs to be Scalable

The data model should be able to accommodate the changing business scenarios in a quick and
efficient way. New data or new data types might have to be included. Data refreshes might have
to be handled effectively.


## Data Modeling for BI

Data modeling for BI consists of the following steps −

- Shaping the data
- Loading the data
- Defining the relationships between the tables
- Defining data types
- Creating new data insights

### Shaping the Data

The data required to build a data model can be from various sources and can be in different
formats. You need to determine which portion of the data from each of these data sources is
required for specific data analysis. This is called Shaping the Data.

For example, if you are retrieving the data of all the employees in an organization, you need to
decide what details of each employee are relevant to the current context. In other words, you
need to determine which columns of the employee table are required to be imported. This is
because, the lesser the number of columns in a table in the data model, the faster will be the
calculations on the table.

### Loading the Data

You need to load the identified data – the data tables with the chosen columns in each of the
tables.

### Defining the Relationships Between Tables

Next, you need to define the logical relationships between the various tables that facilitate
combining data from those tables, i.e. if you have a table – Products - containing data about the
products and a table - Sales - with the various sales transactions of the products, by defining a
relationship between the two tables, you can summarize the sales, product wise.

### Defining Data Types

Identifying the appropriate data types for the data in the data model is crucial for the accuracy of
calculations. For each column in each table that you have imported, you need to define the data
type. For example, text data type, real number data type, integer data type, etc.

### Creating New Data Insights

This is a crucial step in date modeling for BI. The data model that is built might have to be
shared with several people who need to understand data trends and make the required decisions


in a very short time. Hence, creating new data insights from the source data will be effective,
avoiding rework on the analysis.

The new data insights can be in the form of metadata that can be easily understood and used by
specific business people.

## Data Analysis

Once the data model is ready, the data can be analyzed as per the requirement. Presenting the
analysis results is also an important step because the decisions will be made based on the reports.

# Data Modeling Using Excel Power Pivot

Microsoft Excel Power Pivot is an excellent tool for data modeling and analysis.

- Data model is the Power Pivot database.
- DAX is the formula language that can be used to create metadata with the data in the data
    model by means of DAX formulas.
- Power PivotTables in Excel created with the data and metadata in the data model enables
    you to analyze the data and present the results.

In this tutorial, you will learn data modeling with Power Pivot data model and DAX and data
analysis with Power Pivot. If you are new to Power Pivot, please refer to the Excel Power Pivot
tutorial.

You have learnt the data modeling process steps in the previous chapter - Data Modeling and
Analysis Concepts. In this chapter, you will learn how to execute each of those steps with Power
Pivot data model and DAX.

In the following sections, you will learn each of these process steps as applied to Power Pivot
data model and how DAX is used.

## Shaping the Data

In Excel Power Pivot, you can import data from various types of data sources and while
importing, you can view and choose the tables and columns that you want to import.

- Identify the data sources.
- Find the data source types. For example, database or data service or any other data
    source.
- Decide on what data is relevant in the current context.
- Decide on the appropriate data types for the data. In Power Pivot data model, you can
    have only one data type for the entire column in a table.
- Identify which of the tables are the fact tables and which are the dimensional tables.


- Decide on the relevant logical relationships between the tables.

### Loading Data into the Data Model

You can load data into the data model with several options provided in the Power Pivot window
on the Ribbon. You can find these options in the group, Get External Data.

You will learn how to load data from an Access database into the data model in the chapter –
Loading Data into the Data Model.

For illustration purposes, an Access database with Profit and Loss data is used.

### Defining Data Types in the Data Model

The next step in the data modeling process in Power Pivot is defining data types of the columns
in the tables that are loaded into the data model.

You will learn how to define data types of the columns in the tables in the chapter – Defining
Data Types in the Data Model.

### Creating Relationships Between the Tables

The next step in the data modeling process in Power Pivot is creating relationships between the
tables in the data model.

You will learn how to create relationships between the tables in the chapter – Extending the Data
Model.


### Creating New Data Insights

In the data model, you can create metadata necessary for creating new data insights by −

- Creating Calculated Columns
- Creating Date Table
- Creating Measures

You can then analyze the data by creating dynamic Power PivotTables that are based on the
columns in the tables and measures that appear as fields in the PivotTable Fields list.

### Adding Calculated Columns

Calculated columns in a table are the columns that you add to a table by using DAX formulas.

You will learn how to add calculated columns in a table in the data model in the chapter -
Extending the Data Model.

### Creating Date Table

To use Time Intelligence Functions in DAX formulas to create metadata, you require a Date
table. If you are new to Date tables, please refer to the chapter – Understanding Date Tables.

You will learn how to create a Date table in the data model in the chapter – Extending the Data
Model.

### Creating Measures

You can create various measures in the Data table by using the DAX functions and DAX
formulas for different calculations as required for data analysis in the current context.

This is the crucial step of data modeling with DAX.

You will learn how to create the measures for various purposes of profit and loss analysis in the
subsequent chapters.

### Analyzing Data with Power PivotTables

You can create Power PivotTables for each of the facets of profit and loss analysis. As you learn
how to create measures using DAX in the subsequent chapters, you will also learn how to
analyze data with these measures using Power PivotTables.


# Loading Data into the Data Model

You can load data from different types of data sources into the data model. For this, you can find
various options in the Get External Data group on the Ribbon in the Power Pivot window.

As you can observe, you can load data from databases, or from data services or several other
types of data sources.

When you load data from a data source into the data model, a connection will be established with
the data source. This enables data refresh when the source data changes.

## Initiating with a New Data Model

In this section, you will learn how to model the data for profit and loss analysis. The data for
analysis is in a Microsoft Access database.

You can initiate a new data model as follows −

- Open a new Excel workbook
- Click the PowerPivot tab on the Ribbon
- Click Manage in the Data Model group


The Power Pivot window appears. The window will be blank as you have not yet loaded any
data.

## Loading Data from Access Database into the Data Model

To load the data from the Access database, carry out the following steps −

- Click From Database in the Get External Data group on the Ribbon.
- Click From Access in the dropdown list.


Table Import Wizard dialog box appears.

- Browse to the Access file.
- Give a friendly name for the connection.


- Click the Next button. The next part of the Table Import Wizard appears.
- In the Table Import Wizard, select the option – Select from a list of tables and views to
    choose the data to import.


- Click the Next button. The next part of the Table Import Wizard appears as shown in the
    following screenshot.
- Select all the tables.
- Give friendly names to the tables. This is necessary because these names appear in the
    Power PivotTables and hence should be understood by everyone.


## Choosing the Columns in the Tables

You might not require all the columns in the selected tables for the current analysis. Hence, you
need to select only those columns that you selected while shaping the data.

- Click the Preview & Filter button. The next part of the Table Import Wizard -Preview of
    the selected table - appears.


- As seen in the above screenshot, the column headers have check boxes. Select the
    columns you want to import in the selected table.
- Click OK. Repeat the same for the other tables.

## Importing Data into the Data Model

You are at the last stage of loading data into the data model. Click the Finish button in the Table
Import Wizard. The next part of the Table Import Wizard appears.

The importing status will be displayed. The status finally displays Success when data loading is
complete.


## Viewing the Data in the Data Model

The imported tables appear in the Power Pivot window. This is the view of the data model

You can observe the following −


- Each of the tables appear in a separate tab.
- The tab names are the respective table names.
- The area below the data is for the calculations.

## Viewing the Connection Name

Click the Existing Connections in the Get External Data group. Existing Connections dialog box
appears as shown in the following screenshot.

As seen in the above screenshot, the connection name given appears under PowerPivot Data
Connections.

# Defining Data Types in the Data Model

In the Power Pivot data model, the entire data in a column must be of the same data type. To
accomplish accurate calculations, you need to ensure that the data type of each column in each
table in the data model is as per requirement.

### Tables in the Data Model

In the data model created in the previous chapter, there are 3 tables −

- Accounts


- Geography Locn
- Finance Data

## Ensuring Appropriate Data Types

To ensure that the columns in the tables are as required, you need to check their data types in the
Power Pivot window.

- Click a column in a table.
- Note the data type of the column as displayed on the Ribbon in the Formatting group.

If the data type of the selected column is not appropriate, change the data type as follows.

- Click the down arrow next to the data type in the Formatting group.
- Click the appropriate data type in the dropdown list.
- Repeat for every column in all the tables in the data model.


## Columns in the Accounts Table

In the Accounts table, you have the following columns −

```
Sr.No Column & Description
```
#### 1

```
Account
```
```
Contains one account number for each row. The column has unique values and is used in
defining the relationship with the Finance Data table.
```
#### 2

```
Class
```
```
The class associated with each account. Example - Expenses, Net Revenue, etc.
```
#### 3

```
Sub Class
```
```
Describes the type of expense or revenue. Example – People.
```
All the columns in the Accounts table are of descriptive in nature and hence are of Text data
type.

## Columns in the Geography Locn Table

The Geography Locn table contains data about each Profit Center.

The column Profit Center contains one profit center identity for each row. This column has
unique values and is used in defining the relationship with the Finance Data table.

## Columns in the Finance Data Table


In the Finance Data table, you have the following columns −

```
Column Description Data type
Fiscal Month Month and Year Text
Profit Center Profit Center identity Text
```
```
Account
```
```
Account number.
```
```
Each account can have multiple Profit Centers.
```
```
Text
```
```
Budget Monthly budget amounts for each Profit Center. Currency
Actual Monthly actual amounts for each Profit Center. Currency
Forecast Monthly forecast amounts for each profit center. Currency
Actual

```
```
Month end actual number of employees for each Profit Center of
each people Account.
```
```
Whole

```
```
Month end budget number of employees for each Profit Center of
each people Account.
```
```
Whole
Number
Forecast
People
```
```
Month end forecast number of employees for each Profit Center of
each people Account.
```
```
Whole

```
## Types of Tables in the Data Model

Both Accounts and Geography Locn tables are the dimensional tables, also called as **lookup
tables**.

**Finance Data table** is the fact table, also known as the data table. Finance Data table contains
the data required for the profit and analysis calculations. You will also create metadata in the
form of measures and calculated columns in this Finance Data table, so as to model the data for
various types of profit and loss calculations, as you proceed with this tutorial.

# Understanding Data Tables

Data Analysis involves browsing data over time and making calculations across time periods.
For example, you might have to compare the current year’s profits with the previous year’s
profits. Similarly, you might have to forecast the growth and profits in the coming years. For
these, you need to use grouping and aggregations over a period of time.

DAX provides several Time Intelligence functions that help you perform most of such
calculations. However, these DAX functions require a Date table for usage with the other tables
in the data model.

You can either import a Date table along with other data from a data source or you can create a
Date table by yourself in the data model.


In this chapter, you will understand different aspects of Date tables. If you are conversant with
Date tables in the Power Pivot data model, you can skip this chapter and proceed with the
subsequent chapters. Otherwise, you can understand the Date tables in the Power Pivot data
model.

## What is a Date Table?

A Date Table is a table in a data model, with at least one column of contiguous dates across a
required duration. It can have additional columns representing different time periods. However,
what is necessary is the column of contiguous dates, as required by the DAX Time Intelligence
functions.

For example,

- A Date table can have columns such as Date, Fiscal Month, Fiscal Quarter, and Fiscal
    Year.
- A Date table can have columns such as Date, Month, Quarter, and Year.

## Date Table with Contiguous Dates

Suppose you are required to make calculations in the range of a calendar year. Then, the Date
table must have at least one column with a contiguous set of dates, including all the dates in that
specific calendar year.

For example, suppose the data you want to browse has dates from April 1st, 2014 through
November 30th, 2016.

- If you have to report on a calendar year, you need a Date table with a column – Date,
    which contains all the dates from January 1st, 2014 to December 31st, 2016 in a sequence.
- If you have to report on a fiscal year, and your fiscal year end is 30th June, you need a
    Date table with a column – Date, which contains all the dates from July 1st, 2013 to June
    30 th, 2017 in a sequence.
- If you have to report on both calendar and fiscal years, then you can have a single Date
    table spanning the required range of dates.

Your Date table must contain all of the days for the range of every year in the given duration.
Thus, you will get contiguous dates within that period of time.

If you regularly refresh your data with new data, you will have the end date extended by a year
or two, so that you do not have to update your Date table often.

A Date table looks like the following screenshot.


## Adding a Date Table to the Data Model

You can add a Date table to the data model in any of the following ways −

- Importing from a relational database, or any other data source.
- Creating a Date table in Excel and then copying or linking to a new table in Power Pivot.
- Importing from Microsoft Azure Marketplace.

## Creating a Date Table in Excel and Copying to the Data

## Model

Creating a Date table in Excel and copying to the data model is the easiest and most flexible way
of creating a Data table in the data model.

- Open a new worksheet in Excel.
- Type – Date in the first row of a column.
- Type the first date in the date range that you want to create in the second row in the same
    column.
- Select the cell, click the fill handle and drag it down to create a column of contiguous
    dates in the required date range.

For example, type 1/1/2014, click the fill handle and drag down to fill the contiguous dates up to
31/12/2016.

- Click the Date column.
- Click the INSERT tab on the Ribbon.
- Click Table.
- Verify the table range.


- Click OK.

The table of a single column of dates is ready in Excel.

- Select the table.
- Click Copy on the Ribbon.
- Click the Power Pivot window.
- Click Paste on the Ribbon.

This will add the contents of the clipboard to a new table in the data model. Hence, you can use
the same method to create a Date table in an existing data model also.

Paste preview dialog box appears as shown in the following screenshot.


- Type Date in the Table Name box.
- Preview the data.
- Check the box – Use first row as column headers.
- Click OK.

This copies the contents of the clipboard to a new table in the data model.

Now, you have a Date table in the data model with a single column of contiguous dates. The
header of the column is Date as you had given in the Excel table.

## Adding New Date Columns to the Date Table

Next, you can add calculated columns to the Date table as per the requirement for your
calculations.

For example, you can add columns – Day, Month, Year, and Quarter as follows −

- Day

```
=DAY('Date'[Date])
```
- Month

```
=MONTH('Date'[Date])
```
- Year

```
=YEAR('Date'[Date])
```

- Quarter

```
=CONCATENATE ("QTR ", INT (('Date'[Month]+2)/3))
```
The resulting Date table in the data model looks like the following screenshot.

Thus, you can add any number of calculated columns to the Date table. What is important and is
required is that the Date table must have a column of contiguous dates that spans the duration of
time over which you perform calculations.

## Creating a Date Table for a Calendar Year

A calendar year typically includes the dates from 1st January to 31st December of a year and
also includes the holidays marked for that particular year. When you perform calculations, you
might have to take into account only the working days, excluding weekends and holidays.

Suppose, you want to create a Date table for the calendar year 2017.

- Create an Excel table with a column Date, consisting of contiguous dates from 1st January
    2017 to 31st December 2017. (Refer to the previous section to know how to do this.)
- Copy the Excel table and paste it into a new table in the data model. (Refer to the
    previous section to know how to do this.)
- Name the table as Calendar.
- Add the following calculated columns −
    o Day =DAY('Calendar'[Date])
    o Month =MONTH('Calendar'[Date])
    o Year =YEAR('Calendar'[Date])


```
o Day of Week =FORMAT('Calendar'[Date],"DDD")
o Month Name =FORMAT('Calendar'[Date],"MMM")
```
## Adding Holidays to the Calendar Table

Add holidays to the Calendar Table as follows −

- Get the list of declared holidays for the year.
- For example, for the US, you can get the list of holidays for any required year from the
    following link [http://www.calendar-365.com/.](http://www.calendar-365.com/.)
- Copy and paste them into an Excel worksheet.
- Copy the Excel table and paste it into a new table in the data model.
- Name the table as Holidays.


- Next, you can add a calculated column of holidays to the Calendar table using DAX
    LOOKUPVALUE function.

**=LOOKUPVALUE(Holidays[Holiday],Holidays[Date],'Calendar'[Date])**

DAX LOOKUPVALUE function searches the third parameter, i.e. Calendar[Date] in the second
parameter, i.e. Holidays[Date] and returns the first parameter, i.e. Holidays[Holiday] if there is a
match. The result will look like what is shown in the following screenshot.


## Adding Columns to a Fiscal Year

A fiscal year typically includes the dates from 1st of the month after the fiscal year end to the
next fiscal year end. For example, if the fiscal year end is 31st March, then the fiscal year ranges
from 1st April to 31st March.

You can include the fiscal time periods in the calendar table using the DAX formulas −

- Add a measure for FYE

```
FYE:=3
```
- Add the following calculated columns −
    o **Fiscal Year**

```
=IF('Calendar'[Month]<='Calendar'[FYE],'Calendar'[Year],'Calendar'[Year]+1)
```
```
o Fiscal Month
```
```
=IF('Calendar'[Month]<='Calendar'[FYE],12-
'Calendar'[FYE]+'Calendar'[Month],'Calendar'[Month]-'Calendar'[FYE] )
```
```
o Fiscal Quarter
```
```
=INT(('Calendar'[Fiscal Month]+2)/3)
```
## Setting the Date Table Property


When you use DAX Time Intelligence functions such as TOTALYTD, PREVIOUSMONTH,
and DATESBETWEEN, they require metadata to work correctly. Date Table Property sets such
metadata.

To set the Date Table property −

- Select Calendar table in the Power Pivot window.
- Click the Design tab on the Ribbon.
- Click Mark as Date Table in the Calendars group.
- Click Mark as Date Table in the dropdown list.

Mark as Date Table dialog box appears. Select the Date column in the Calendar table. This has to
be the column of Date data type and has to have unique values. Click OK.


# Extending the Data Model

In this chapter, you will learn how to extend the data model created in the previous chapters.
Extending a data model includes −

- Addition of tables
- Addition of calculated columns in an existing table
- Creation of measures in an existing table

Of these, creating the measures is crucial, as it involves providing new data insights in the data
model that will enable those using the data model avoid rework and also save time while
analyzing the data and decision making.

As Profit and Loss Analysis involves working with time periods and you will be using DAX
Time Intelligence functions, you require a Date table in the data model.

If you are new to Date tables, go through the chapter – Understanding Date Tables.

You can extend the data model as follows −

- To create a relationship between the data table, i.e. Finance Data table and the Date table,
    you need to create a calculated column Date in the Finance Data table.
- To perform different types of calculations, you need to create relationships between the
    data table - Finance Data and the lookup tables – Accounts and Geography Locn.
- You need to create various measures that help you perform several calculations and carry
    out the required analysis.


These steps essentially constitute the data modeling steps for Profit and Loss Analysis using the
data model. However, this is the sequence of steps for any type of data analysis that you want to
perform with Power Pivot data model.

Further, you will learn how to create the measures and how to use them in the Power PivotTables
in the subsequent chapters. This will give you sufficient understanding of data modeling with
DAX and data analysis with Power PivotTables.

## Adding a Date Table to the Data Model

Create a Date table for the time periods spanning the fiscal years as follows −

- Create a table with a single column with header – Date and contiguous dates ranging
    from 7/1/2011 to 6/30/2018 in a new Excel worksheet.
- Copy the table from Excel and paste it into the Power Pivot window. This will create a
    new table in the Power Pivot data model.
- Name the table as Date.
- Ensure that the Date column in the Date table is of data type - Date (DateTime).

Next, you need to add the calculated columns – Fiscal Year, Fiscal Quarter, Fiscal Month and
Month to the Date table as follows −

### Fiscal Year

Suppose the fiscal year end is June 30th. Then, a fiscal year spans from 1st July to 30th June. For
example, the period July 1st, 2011 (7/1/2011) to June 30th, 2012 (6/30/2012) will be the fiscal
year 2012.

In the Date table, suppose you want to represent the same as FY2012.

- You need to first extract the financial year part of the Date and append it with FY.
    o For the dates in the months July 2011 to December 2011, the financial year is
       1+2011.
    o For the dates in the months January 2012 to June 2012, the financial year is
       0+2012.
    o To generalize, if the Month of Financial Year End is FYE, do the following −

```
Integer Part of ((Month – 1)/FYE) + Year
```
```
o Next, take the rightmost 4 characters to obtain the Financial Year.
```
- In DAX, you can represent the same as −

```
RIGHT(INT((MONTH('Date'[Date])-1)/'Date'[FYE])+YEAR('Date'[Date]),4)
```
- Add the calculated column Fiscal Year in the Date table with the DAX formula −


```
="FY"&RIGHT(INT((MONTH('Date'[Date])-1)/'Date'[FYE])+YEAR('Date'[Date]),4)
```
### Fiscal Quarter

If FYE represents the month of financial year end, the financial quarter is obtained as

```
Integer Part of ((Remainder of ((Month+FYE-1)/12) + 3)/3)
```
- In DAX, you can represent the same as −

```
INT((MOD(MONTH('Date'[Date])+'Date'[FYE]-1,12)+3)/3)
```
- Add the calculated column Fiscal Quarter in the Date table with the DAX formula −

```
='Date'[FiscalYear]&"-Q"&FORMAT( INT((MOD(MONTH('Date'[Date]) +
'Date'[FYE]-1,12) + 3)/3), "0")
```
### Fiscal Month

If FYE represents the financial year end, the financial month period is obtained as

```
(Remainder of (Month+FYE-1)/12) + 1
```
- In DAX, you can represent the same as −

```
MOD(MONTH('Date'[Date])+'Date'[FYE]-1,12)+1
```
- Add the calculated column Fiscal Month in the Date table with the DAX formula −

```
='Date'[Fiscal Year]&"-P" & FORMAT(MOD(MONTH([Date])+[FYE]-1,12)+1,"00")
```
### Month

Finally, add the calculated column Month that represents the month number in a financial year as
follows −

_=FORMAT(MOD(MONTH([Date])+[FYE]-1,12)+1,"00") & "-" & FORMAT([Date],"mmm")_

The resulting Date table looks like the following screenshot.


Mark the table – Date as Date Table with the column - Date as the column with unique values as
shown in the following screenshot.

## Adding Calculated Columns

To create a relationship between the Finance Data table and the Date table, you require a column
of Date values in the Finance Data table.


- Add a calculated column Date in the Finance Data table with the DAX formula −

```
= DATEVALUE ('Finance Data'[Fiscal Month])
```
## Defining Relationships Between Tables in the Data Model

You have the following tables in the data model −

- Data table - Finance Data
- Lookup tables - Accounts and Geography Locn
- Date table - Date

To define Relationships between the tables in the data model, following are the steps −

- View the tables in the Diagram View of the Power Pivot.
- Create the following relationships between the tables −
    o Relationship between Finance Data table and Accounts table with the column
       Account.
    o Relationship between Finance Data table and Geography Locn table with the
       column Profit Center.
    o Relationship between Finance Data table and Date table with the column Date.


## Hiding Columns from Client Tools

If there are any columns in a data table that you won’t be using as fields in any PivotTable, you
can hide them in the data model. Then, they will not be visible in the PivotTable Fields list.

In the Finance Data table, you have 4 columns – Fiscal Month, Date, Account and Profit Center
that you won’t be using as fields in any PivotTable. Hence, you can hide them so that they do not
appear in the PivotTable Fields list.

- Select the columns - Fiscal Month, Date, Account, and Profit Center in the Finance Data
    table.
- Right-click and select Hide from Client Tools in the dropdown list.

## Creating Measures in the Tables

You are all set for data modeling and analysis with DAX using the data model and Power
PivotTables.

In the subsequent chapters, you will learn how to create measures and how to use them in Power
PivotTables. You will create all the measures in the data table, i.e. Finance Data table.

You will create measures using DAX formulas in the data table – Finance Data, which you can
use in any number of PivotTables for the data analysis. The measures are essentially the
metadata. Creating measures in the data table is part of data modeling and summarizing them in
the Power PivotTables is part of data analysis.

# Base Finance Measures and Analysis


You can create various measures in the data model to be used in any number of Power
PivotTables. This forms the data modeling and analysis process with the data model using DAX.

As you have learnt earlier in the previous sections, data modeling and analysis is dependent on
specific business and context. In this chapter, you will learn data modeling and analysis based on
a sample Profit and Loss database to understand how to create the required measures and use
them in various Power PivotTables.

You can apply the same method for data modeling and analysis for any business and context

## Creating Measures Based on Finance Data

To create any financial report, you need to make calculations of amounts for a particular time
period, organization, account, or geographical location. You also need to perform the headcount
and cost per headcount calculations. In the data model, you can create base measures that can be
reused in creating other measures. This is an effective way of data modeling with DAX.

In order to perform calculations for profit and loss data analysis, you can create measures such as
sum, year-over-year, year-to-date, quarter-to-date, variance, headcount, cost per headcount, etc.
You can use these measures in the Power PivotTables to analyze the data and report the analysis
results.

In the following sections, you will learn how to create the base finance measures and analyze
data with those measures. The measures are termed as base measures as they can be used in
creating other financial measures. You will also learn how to create measures for the previous
time periods and use them in the analysis.

## Creating Base Finance Measures

In the finance data analysis, budget and forecast play a major role.

### Budget

A budget is an estimate of a company’s revenues and expenses for a financial year. The budget is
calculated at the beginning of a financial year keeping in view the company’s goals and targets.
Budget measures need to be analyzed from time to time during the financial year, as the market
conditions may change and the company may have to align its goals and targets to the current
trends in the industry.

### Forecast

A financial forecast is an estimate of a company's future financial outcomes by examining the
company’s historical data of revenues and expenses. You can use financial forecasting for the
following −


- To determine how to allocate budget for a future period.
- To track the expected performance of the company.
- To take timely decisions to address shortfalls against the targets, or to maximize an
    emerging opportunity.

### Actuals

To perform the budgeting and forecasting calculations, you require the actual revenue and
expenses at any point in time.

You can create the following 3 base finance measures that can be used in creating other financial
measures in the data mode −

- Budget Sum
- Actual Sum
- Forecast Sum

These measures are the aggregation sums over the columns – Budget, Actual, and Forecast in the
Finance Data table.

Create the base finance measures as follows −

**Budget Sum**

_Budget Sum:=SUM('Finance Data'[Budget])_

**Actual Sum**

_Actual Sum:=SUM('Finance Data'[Actual])_

**Forecast Sum**

_Forecast Sum:=SUM('Finance Data'[Forecast])_

## Analyzing Data with Base Finance Measures

With the base finance measures and the Date table, you can perform your analysis as follow −

- Create a Power PivotTable.
- Add the field Fiscal Year from the Date table to Rows.
- Add the measures Budget Sum, Actual Sum, and Forecast Sum (that appear as fields in
    the PivotTable Fields list) to Values.


## Creating Finance Measures for Previous Periods

With the three base finance measures and the Date table, you can create other finance measures.

Suppose you want to compare the Actual Sum of a Quarter with the Actual Sum of previous
Quarter. You can create the measure - Prior Quarter Actual Sum.

```
Prior Quarter Actual Sum:=CALCULATE([Actual Sum],
DATEADD('Date'[Date],1,QUARTER))
```
Similarly, you can create the measure - Prior Year Actual Sum.

```
Prior Year Actual Sum:=CALCULATE([Actual Sum], DATEADD('Date'[Date],1,YEAR))
```
## Analyzing Data with Finance Measures for Previous Periods

With the base measures, measures for previous periods and the Date table, you can perform your
analysis as follows −

- Create a Power PivotTable.
- Add the field Fiscal Quarter from the Date table to Rows.
- Add the measures Actual Sum and Prior Quarter Actual Sum to Values.
- Create another Power PivotTable.
- Add the field Fiscal Year from the Date table to Rows.
- Add the measures Actual Sum and Prior Year Actual Sum to Values.


# YoY Finance Measures and Analysis

Year-over-Year (YoY) is a measure of growth. It is obtained by subtracting the actual sum of the
previous year from the actual sum.

If the result is positive, it reflects an increase in actual, and if it is negative, it reflects a decrease
in actual, i.e. if we calculate year-over-year as −

```
year-over-year = (actual sum –prior year actual sum)
```
- If the actual sum > the prior year actual sum, year-over-year will be positive.
- If the actual sum < the prior year actual sum, year-over-year will be negative.

In the financial data, accounts such as the expense accounts will have debit (positive) amounts
and the revenue accounts will have credit (negative) amounts. Hence, for the expense accounts,
the above formula works fine.

However, for the revenue accounts, it should be the reverse, i.e.

- If the actual sum > the prior year actual sum, year-over-year should be negative.
- If the actual sum < the prior year actual sum, year-over-year should be positive.

Hence for the revenue accounts, you have to calculate year-over-year as −

```
year-over-year = -(actual sum – prior year actual sum)
```
## Creating Year-over-Year Measure

You can create Year-over-Year measure with the following DAX formula −

_YoY:=IF(CONTAINS(Accounts, Accounts[Class],"Net Revenue"),-([Actual Sum]-[Prior Year
Actual Sum]), [Actual Sum]-[Prior Year Actual Sum])_

In the above DAX formula −

- DAX CONTAINS function returns TRUE, if a row has "Net Revenue" in the column
    Class in the Accounts table.
- DAX IF function then returns –([Actual Sum]-[ Prior Year Actual Sum]).
- Otherwise, DAX IF function returns [Actual Sum]-[ Prior Year Actual Sum].

## Creating Year-over-Year Percentage Measure

You can represent Year-over-Year as a percentage with the ratio −


```
(YoY) / (Prior Year Actual Sum)
```
You can create the Year-over-Year Percentage measure with the following DAX formula −

_YoY %:=IF([Prior Year Actual Sum], [YoY] / ABS([Prior Year Actual Sum]),BLANK())_

DAX IF function is used in the above formula to ensure that there is no division by zero.

## Analyzing Data with Year-over-Year Measures

Create a Power PivotTable as follows −

- Add the fields Class and Sub Class from the Accounts table to Rows.
- Add the measures – Actual Sum, Prior Year Actual Sum, YoY and YoY % to Values.
- Insert a Slicer on the field Fiscal Year from the Date table.
- Select FY2016 in the Slicer.

# Budget Measures and Analysis

Budgeting involves estimating the cash flows of a company over a financial year. The financial
position of the company, its goals, expected revenues, and expenses are taken into account in
budgeting.


However, the market conditions may change during the financial year and the company may
have to reset its goals. This requires analyzing the financial data with the budget estimated at the
beginning of the financial year (Budget Sum) and the actual expended sum from the beginning of
the financial year to date (YTD Actual Sum).

At any time during a financial year, you can calculate the following −

### Unexpended Balance

Unexpended Balance is the budget remaining after the actual expenses, i.e.

**_Unexpended Balance = YTD Budget Sum – YTD Actual Sum_**

### Budget Attainment %

Budget Attainment % is the percentage of the budget that you have spent to date, i.e.

**_Budget Attainment % = YTD Actual Sum/YTD Budget Sum_**

These calculations help those companies that use budgeting to make decisions.

### Creating Unexpended Balance Measure

You can create Unexpended Balance measure as follows −

_Unexpended Balance:=CALCULATE( [YTD Budget Sum],ALL('Finance Data'[Date]) )-[YTD
Actual Sum]_

# Forecast Measures and Analysis

You can use Forecast measures to analyze the finance data and help an organization make
necessary adjustments in its goals and targets for the year, to align the company’s performance to
the changing business requirements.

You need to update the forecasts regularly to keep up with the changes. You can then compare
the most recent forecast to the budget for the rest of the period in the financial year so that the
company can make the required adjustments to meet the business changes.

At any time during a financial year, you can calculate the following −

### Forecast Attainment %

Forecast Attainment % is the percentage of the forecast sum that you have spent to date, i.e.

**_Forecast Attainment % = YTD Actual Sum/YTD Forecast Sum_**

### Forecast Unexpended Balance

Forecast Unexpended Balance is the Forecast Sum remaining after the actual expenses, i.e

**_Forecast Unexpended Balance = YTD Forecast Sum – YTD Actual Sum_**

### Budget Adjustment

Budget Adjustment is the adjustment in the budget sum an organization needs to make (an
increase or decrease) based on the forecast.

**_Budget Adjustment = Forecast Unexpended Balance - Unexpended Balance_**

The budget needs to be increased if the resulting value is positive. Otherwise, it can be adjusted
for some other purpose.


### Creating Forecast Attainment Percentage Measure

You can create Forecast Attainment Percentage measure as follows −

_Forecast Attainment Percentage:= IF([YTD Forecast Sum], [YTD Actual Sum]/[YTD Forecast
Sum], BLANK())_

You can create the Count of Months measures that can be used in creating Headcount measures
and Cost Per Head measures. These measures count the distinct values of Fiscal Month column
where the Actual column / Budget column / Forecast column has non-zero values in the Finance
Data table. This is required because the Finance Data table contains zero values in the Actual
column and those rows are to be excluded while calculating Headcount and Cost per Head.

You can create Ending Headcount measures for a specific period of time. The Ending Headcount
is the sum of the people as on the last date in the specified period for which we have a non-blank
sum of people.

The Ending Headcount is obtained as follows −

- For a Month − Sum of People at the end of the specific Month.
- For a Quarter − Sum of People at the end of the last Month of the specific Quarter.

# Cost Per Headcount Measures and Analysis

You have learnt about the two major categories of Measures −

- Finance Measures.
- Headcount Measures.

The third major category of measures that you will learn is People Cost Measures. Any
organization will be interested to know the annualized cost per head. Annualized cost per head
represents the cost to the company of having one employee on a full year basis.

To create Cost Per Head measures, you need to first create certain preliminary People Cost
Measures. In the Accounts table, you have a column – Sub Class that contains People as one of
the values. Hence, you can apply a filter on the Accounts table on the Sub Class column to obtain
the filter context onto the Finance Data table to obtain People Cost.

You can use thus obtain People Cost measures and Count of Months measures to create
Annualized People Cost measures. You can finally create Annualized Cost Per Head measures
from Annualized People Cost measures and Average Head Count measures.

### Creating Actual People Cost Measure

You can create Actual People Cost measure as follows −


```
Actual People Cost:=CALCULATE('Finance Data'[Actual Sum], FILTER('Finance Data',
RELATED(Accounts[Sub Class])="People"))
```
### Creating Budget People Cost Measure

You can create Budget People Cost measure as follows −

```
Budget People Cost:=CALCULATE('Finance Data'[Budget Sum], FILTER('Finance Data',
RELATED(Accounts[Sub Class])="People"))
```
### Creating Forecast People Cost Measure

You can create Forecast People Cost measure as follows −

```
Forecast People Cost:=CALCULATE('Finance Data'[Forecast Sum], FILTER('Finance Data',
RELATED(Accounts[Sub Class])="People"))
```
### Creating Annualized Actual People Cost Measure

You can create Annualized Actual People Cost measure as follows −

```
Annualized Actual People Cost:=IF([CountOfActualMonths],[Actual People
Cost]*12/[CountOfActualMonths],BLANK())
```
### Creating Annualized Budget People Cost Measure

You can create Annualized Budget People Cost measure as follows −

```
Annualized Budget People Cost:=IF([CountOfBudgetMonths], [Budget People
Cost]*12/[CountOfBudgetMonths],BLANK())
```
### Creating Annualized Forecast People Cost Measure

You can create Annualized Forecast People Cost measure as follows −

```
Annualized Forecast People Cost:=IF([CountOfForecastMonths],[Forecast People
Cost]*12/[CountOfForecastMonths],BLANK())
```
### Creating Actual Annualized Cost Per Head Measure

You can create Actual Annualized Cost Per Head (CPH) measure as follows −

```
Actual Annualized CPH:=IF([Actual Average Headcount], [Annualized Actual People
Cost]/[Actual Average Headcount],BLANK() )
```

### Creating Budget Annualized Cost Per Head Measure

You can create Budget Annualized Cost Per Head (CPH) measure as follows −

```
Budget Annualized CPH:=IF([Budget Average Headcount],[Annualized Budget People
Cost]/[Budget Average Headcount],BLANK())
```
### Creating Forecast Annualized Cost Per Head Measure

You can create Forecast Annualized Cost Per Head (CPH) measure as follows −

```
Forecast Annualized CPH:=IF([Forecast Average Headcount],[Annualized Forecast People
Cost]/[Forecast Average Headcount], BLANK())
```
### Creating Prior Year Actual Annualized Cost Per Head Measure

You can create Prior Year Actual Annualized Cost Per Head (CPH) measure as follows −

```
Prior Year Actual Annualized CPH:=CALCULATE([Actual Annualized CPH],
DATEADD('Date'[Date],-1,YEAR) )
```
## Analyzing Data with Cost Per Head Measures

Create a Power PivotTable as follows −

- Add the fields Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Month from Date table to Rows.
- Add the measures Actual Annualized CPH, Budget Annualized CPH, and Forecast
    Annualized CPH to Columns.
- Add the field Fiscal Year from Date table to Filters.
- Select FY2016 in the Filter.


Create another Power PivotTable as follows −

- Add the field Fiscal Quarter from Date table to Rows.
- Add the measures Actual Annualized CPH, and Prior Year Actual Annualized CPH to
    Columns.
- Insert a Slicer on the field Fiscal Year from Date table.
- Select FY2015 and FY2016 on the Slicer.

# Rate Variance and Volume Variance


You have learnt how to create measures for Annualized Cost Per Head and Total Headcount.
You can use these measures to create Rate Variance and Volume Variance measures.

- Rate Variance measures calculate what portion of a Currency Variance is caused by
    differences in Cost Per Head.
- Volume Variance measures calculate how much of the Currency Variance is driven by
    fluctuation in Headcount.

### Creating Variance to Budget Rate Measure

You can create Variance to Budget Rate measure as follows −

```
VTB Rate:=([Budget Annualized CPH]/12-[Actual Annualized CPH]/12)*[Actual Total Head
Count]
```
### Creating Variance to Budget Volume Measure

You can create Variance to Budget Volume measure as follows −

```
VTB Volume:=[VTB Total Head Count]*[Budget Annualized CPH]/12
```
## Analyzing Data with Variance to Budget Measures

Create a Power PivotTable as follows −

- Add the fields Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Month from Date table to Rows.
- Add the measures Actual Annualized CPH, Budget Annualized CPH, VTB Rate, VTB
    Volume, VTB Sum to Values.
- Add the fields Fiscal Year from Date table and Sub Class from Accounts table to Filters.
- Select FY2016 in the Fiscal Year Filter.
- Select People in the Sub Class Filter.
- Filter Row Labels for Fiscal Quarter values FY2016-Q1 and FY2016-Q2.


You can observe the following in the above PivotTable −

- VTB Sum value shown is only for Sub Class – People.
- For Fiscal Quarter FY2016-Q1, VTB Sum is $4,705,568, VTB Rate is $970,506,297, and
    VTB Volume is $-965,800,727.
- VTB Rate measure calculates that $970,506,297 of the Variance to Budget (VTB Sum) is
    caused by the difference in Cost per Head, and $-965,800,727 is caused by the difference
    in Headcount.
- If you add VTB Rate and VTB Volume, you will get $4,705,568, the same value as
    returned by VTB Sum for Sub Class People.
- Similarly, for Fiscal Quarter FY2016-Q2, VTB Rate is $1,281,467,662, and VTB
    Volume is $-1,210,710,978. If you add VTB Rate and VTB Volume, you will get
    $70,756,678, which is the VTB Sum value shown in the PivotTable.

### Creating Year-Over-Year Rate Measure

You can create Year-Over-Year Rate measure as follows −

```
YoY Rate:=([Actual Annualized CPH]/12-[Prior Year Actual Annualized CPH]/12)*[Actual
Total Head Count]
```
### Creating Year-Over-Year Volume Measure

You can create Year-Over-Year Volume measure as follows −

```
YoY Volume:=[YoY Actual Total Headcount]*[Prior Year Actual Annualized CPH]/12
```
### Creating Variance to Forecast Rate Measure

You can create Variance to Forecast Rate measure as follows −


```
